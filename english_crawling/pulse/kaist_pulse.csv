" U.S. imaging solution company Cellect LLC has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., the latest to join the growing list of names engaged in patent lawsuits with the South Korean semiconductor and IT giant. According to sources on Thursday, Cellect demanded a jury trial from a federal court in Colorado in its filing against Samsung Electronics in Seoul and Samsung Electronics America last month. A jury trial is not entitled to dismissal of the lawsuit. Cellect claims Samsung manufactured and sold smartphones and tablets by using its technology related to CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensing, which is widely used inside smartphones and digital cameras for its fast data conversion speed and low power consumption. Cellect targets a wide range of Samsung products based on the punitive remedy under Section 284 of the U.S. Patent Act, which grants federal judges the discretion to increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed. Samsung Electronics has become a major target of patent litigation in Korea and elsewhere since last year. Taiwan’s CyWee Group filed a suit against the company for patent infringement on a particular combination of sensors of a 3D pointing device, while U.S. data encryption firm PACid Technologies sued Samsung Electronics, claiming the latest Galaxy S phones have infringed its patents related to biometric solutions. Early last month KAIST IP, the licensing arm of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), also filed a patent suit against Samsung, claiming its 3-dimensional semiconductor process technology was infringed by the company. Market watchers say Samsung Electronics may face additional patent lawsuits from tech companies or patent trolls seeking huge compensations, given the Korean tech giant’s market position and profitability in the global semiconductor market. Shares of Samsung Electronics finished Friday up 0.8 percent at 44,200 won ($38.86).

" Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) has taken the top spot among Korean universities in the latest Times Higher Education (THE) Asia University Rankings published on Wednesday. KAIST was ranked eighth in Asia, and followed by Seoul National University or SNU (second in Korea, ninth in Asia) and POSTECH (third in Korea, tenth in Asia). This is the first time that KAIST has attained the top position in Korea in this ranking of Asian universities since it was introduced in 2013. The university jumped two spots from last year to rank first in Korea with outstanding improvement in the category of teaching and research. SNU remained at second position while POSTECH fell by one rank to third. The top five positions in Asia were claimed by universities in Singapore, China and Hong Kong. The National University of Singapore (NUS) topped the Asian list for two consecutive years. China’s Peking University and Tsinghua University took the second and third spots, respectively. The fourth place was taken by Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the fifth by University of Hong Kong and the sixth by its neighbor Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Tokyo University which took pole position in the 2015 Asian rankings ranked seventh this year for two straight years.  Three Korean universities entered the Asia’s top 10 and a total of 15 were included in the top 100, up by two from 13 in 2016. But Korea still has a long way to go as its top three schools stay among the lowest in the top 10 Asian universities. Overall, Korean universities showed low scores in key indicators of research, citation and international outlook. In contrast, China and Hong Kong have the highest density of top institutions with 24 Chinese universities and six Hong Kong universities in the top 100. “After intensive investment and globalization efforts, many other Chinese universities like Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have become distinguished. This is different from 20 to 30 years ago when only Peking University and Tsinghua University were known to the outside,” said Phil Baty, THE rankings editor.

" SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won on Thursday indicated SK Hynix would go bolder in the bid for the semiconductor division of Japan’s Toshiba Corp., a deal that would change the global landscape in the flash memory industry. “The current stage is non-binding so the pricing does not matter,” Chey told reporters after a lecture at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) campus in Dongdaemun, central Seoul. “We won’t be the same once the real binding bidding process kicks off.” Toshiba is expected to receive final bids in May before selecting a preferred bidder in June. Chey’s comments were made in response to skepticism over the world’s second largest dynamic random access memory (DRAM) maker’s bid over Toshiba’s chip-making division primarily focused in the non-volatile storage (NAND) amid reports of its price offering to be lower than others. SK Hynix reportedly had proposed to acquire 50 percent plus management right in Toshiba’s semiconductor division for around $9 billion. Toshiba is offering from 50 percent to 100 percent in the lucrative flash memory whose prospects are bright due to explosive demand for the chip to power mobile devices. SK Hynix is relatively weak in the NAND field, commanding 5th rank. According to Japan’s Mainichi Shimbun, potential buyers of world’s second largest flash memory maker have been narrowed down to four bidders - SK Hynix, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the United States’ Western Digital Corp., and private equity firm Silver Laker Partners. Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, is unrivalled in the bidding war by offering as much as 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion). Chey’s latest remarks suggest the conglomerate will go more aggressive in the final bid. SK Hynix has joined up with Japan’s financial investors to participate in the preliminary tender that closed on March 29. In 2012, SK Hynix attempted to take over Japan’s troubled semiconductor maker Elpida Memory Inc. but pulled out later. Elpida is now owned by U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc.

" Hanwha Chemical Corp., a South Korean petrochemical producer, has embarked on commercial production of a phthalate-free plasticizer at its Ulsan factory, throwing down the gauntlet to the world’s leading, only non-phthalate plasticizer makers BASF and Evonik. The company announced on Thursday that it has finally started mass production of its phthalate-free plasticizer dubbed ECO-DEHCH eight years after it began its development and the annual production capacity is 15,000 tons. The ECO-DEHCH can replace existing plasticizers that contains toxic phthalate restricting its use in wallpapers, flooring materials and children’s toys, according to the company. Currently, Germany’s BASF and Evonik are the only producers of phthalate-free plasticizers in the world. The global plasticizer market is estimated to be worth 8 trillion won ($7.14 billion) a year, of which 1.5 trillion won sales are generated from eco-friendly products. The non-phthalate plasticize market has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent. The successful development and production of ECO-DEHCH is credited to Hanwha Chemical chief executive Kim Chang-bum, who has been dedicated to an industry-academia research partnership with Seoul National and KAIST to develop new technology. The new product met safety requirements in an FDA test late last year. A toxicity test was also conducted by SGS, a leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company, to confirm the product’s applicability to children’s toys.

" South Korean researchers have developed a new semiconductor patterning technology that uses a camera flash instead of standard photolithography. The research team at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) said on Tuesday they found a new method to create a 7 nanometer conductive pattern on a substrate by exposing it to a short burst of a camera flashlight, which takes about one-thousandth of a second. The process used to transfer a pattern to a layer on the microchip is called lithography, but standard photolithography is limited in microfabrication with less than 10 nanometers in size. Micropatterning is required to make high-capacity and high-performance semiconductor devices. The new technology is expected to be applied to develop microchips dedicated to artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), according to the research team.

" KB Capital, the vehicle installment financing and leasing services arm of KB Financial Group, said on Thursday it has partnered with Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) to develop a technology to valuate used cars based on deep learning, part of artificial intelligence. The input of more than 50 car data including mileage, fuel economy and models, will enable more accurate pricing for the asset. The new technology will be used to refine KB Capital’s used car transaction platform named KB Cha Cha Cha. The deep learning model will run on a server equipped with the latest GPU processors, allowing customers to access price information on the company’s website. The platform was designed to provide a reliable used car price and prepare traders better for car deals. It became quickly popular, hitting 10 million visitors only nine months after the launch in June 2016. The platform does not play as a profit center for the operator but can attract customers to seek KB Capital’s financing services for used cars, according to the company. KB Capital is also hopeful that the deep learning-based car price calculation technology will contribute to its overseas business. In 2016, KB Capital set up a joint venture in Laos called KB KOLAO Leasing with KOLAO Group, an automobile and motorcycle maker founded by a Korean businessman there.

" Korean researchers have developed a sensor that can detect tiny amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas (1 ppm or less), the compound responsible for bad breath, in human breath. A Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) team led by Prof. Kim Il-Doo and Prof. Cha Joon-hee said on Tuesday they successfully developed a sensitive and portable detector for halitosis that doctors could use to diagnose the condition in a fast and inexpensive manner. To develop their sensor, the team used lead (II) acetate (Pb(Ac)₂) - a chemical that turns brown when exposed to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) gas. Lead acetate was anchored to a 3D nanofiber web to provide numerous sites for lead acetate and hydrogen sulfide gas to react. The team said they could detect trace amounts of bad breath with the naked eye in only 1 minute by monitoring a color change from white to brown on the sensor surface. The research result was published in the American Chemical Society (ACS)’s international journal Analytical Chemistry on May 23. The researchers plan to further their research for applications of the sensor to detect disease, drug or gas. The color-changing sensor technology was filed for patent applications in Korea and the U.S. for commercial development. The color-changing gas sensor is based on a nanofiber with a large surface, offering superior sensitivity to conventional paper-based sensors and it can be used like a litmus test, said Prof. Kim.

" Just in the last decade, exports from the less developed countries have grown by over 400%. Some even ask us to believe that the world is flat and that nothing can stop globalization. But nobody is talking much about the darker side of globalization. The last major financial crisis was in 1996 when Asian countries fell like dominoes due to heavy corporate indebtedness, foreign exchange exposure and flight of financial capital from countries. The western countries blamed the Asians for bad corporate governance and inept government. This time around, the financial crisis of 2008 has affected the whole world, with the western countries falling one after the other. The fingers are pointing directly to heavy consumer indebtedness, bad loans based on housing/real estate, high portfolio exposure to housing/real-estate securities and liquidity of financial institutions. The Asian countries blame the west for bad risk management and lax government regulations allowing western citizens, particularly US, to assume excessive debt. One can go back to the early days of trading between countries when labor was taken from one country to another, be it people from Africa to United States as slaves or women for the sake of comforting soldiers in times of war. Or in more recent times, illegal and often dangerous materials used in manufactured goods that are being exported to other countries, such as additives to milk products or lead in painted toys. And of course, we have not even started to address the damage that has been done to the planet in terms of global warming. The recent meeting in Copenhagen showed the ineffectiveness of governments and leaders in addressing global problems. It is clear that the more the world globalizes, the larger are the problems of globalization. Globalization now forces management (be it in the private, public or non-profit sector) to understand subtle issues such as corporate social responsibility and sustainability as well as ethical issues in people displacement, fair compensation, legal and transparent processes. Educational institutions, especially business schools, can and should lead by educating future managers and leaders on the role of corporate social responsibility as well as union social responsibility and worker/individual social responsibility to our local communities, to our environment and to the world at large. It should be the responsibility of educational institutions to innovate in curriculum (like the Green MBA that KAIST Business School pioneered many years ago) and expose our students to global experiences in helping disadvantaged people, organizations and communities of the world. It is time to start using education as the mighty force that it is to right some of the wrongs that globalization invariably brings and create a better environment and opportunity for future generations.

"South Korea jumped into research in robots about 30 years later than the US or Japan. Korea’s development of the first generation robots working in the manufacturing sector began as late as in 1990s. But the country’s robots, an achievement of many scientists, are evolving and rapidly catching up with those of developed countries.  Korea’s progress in robots cannot be told without mentioning Oh Jun-ho, professor of mechanical engineering at KAIST. He led the development of the world’s second humanoid robot ‘Hubo’ in 2004 following Japan. Hubo was developed after three years of research costing one billion won ($933,080), whereas Japan’s Asimo took 15 years and cost 300 billion won. “We successfully made Hubo at a low research cost because many researchers worked together,” said professor Oh. The researchers who made prominent contributions include Kim Jung-hoon, professor at Yonsei University who developed Hubo’s predecessor “KHR-1’; Kim Jung-yup, professor at Seoul National University of Science and Technology and leading expert in robots’ walking technology and; Park Il-woo, professor at Kwangwoon University who handled machine design.

"‘Azar,’ a mobile video messenger application developed by 35-year old South Korean youngsters, reached over 11 million downloads to emerge as the ‘Facebook of Arab.’ The app took the crown in the number of downloads in Taiwan just in two months after the launch in November in 2013, and has been enjoying explosive growth in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt and Israel with a total of 25 million users around the world.  According to the global mobile application analysis firm App Annie, Azar ranked first in Turkey and Kuwait, third in Egypt and forth in Saudi Arabia in application revenue (excluding games) in July. President Barack Obama in July invited Mr Ahn Sang-il of Hyperconnect that created this app, to the Global Engagement Summit at Nairobi, Kenya. Director Chung Kang-sik, who had worked at Korea Financial Telecommunications & Clearings Institute in August 2013, succeeded in developing a mobile voice call platform after over 12 months of hard work. Mr Ahn came up with a blueprint of formulating the live video app which enables people around the world to chat and make friends.” Yong Hyun-tack, an executive in charge of app development, completed Azar while staying in the office for two months. For Middle Easterners who have enjoyed watching videos at home and have few opportunities to meet foreigners because of conservative atmosphere in society, the mobile messenger that connects them to foreign friends through a screen gained tremendous popularity. Kim Sung-jin, 31, CEO of a start-up i-KAIST, which has caused a sensation in the smart school market, startled the world by jumping into the global smart TV market by joining hands with Al Jazeera Media Network, the largest media group in the Arab world.

"“The housing market slump stems from a structural problem so it is difficult to fix it in the short term,” said Financial Supervisory Service Governor Kim Jong Chang on September 7. “The market slump is prolonged along with reduced property transactions and rising stockpiles of unsold apartment houses,” he said at a breakfast lecture delivered at KAIST. As reasons behind the structural problem, he picked the fall of households capable of purchasing houses, high possibility of debt rescheduling with the rate hike and the government’s position unable to expand a support package because it wants to stabilize a mid-and long-term budget. Regarding household debt, “The absolute term is high and they tend to rely heavily on real estate assets. It is less likely for mortgage loans to go sour in a short period of time, but the prolonged housing market recession and the continuation of a rate hike could hurt the ability to repay debts among the low-income class,” he said.

" South Korea will establish a cutting-edge institute focusing on brain science in Daegu, the southeastern part of the nation. The education ministry said on June 3 it selected a consortium led by Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST) as an agency to attract the hub of Korea’s brain research. The consortium had participated in bid for the government’s project as a solo bidder after two other consortiums Daejeon City-KAIST and Incheon City-Seoul National University did not reconfirm their intent last April. The education ministry plans to begin construction of the brain research center next year and launch it in early 2014 as an annex research center of DGIST. The government will invest more than 160 billion won ($148.1 million) in the establishment of the research center, one of the nation’s key science and technology projects. Local government will cover the cost of land purchase and construction worth 100 billion won. The central government will provide 63.8 billion won for operational expenses before the establishment and then 20 to 30 billion won as research expenses every year. The new institute will involve life science, nano and IT technologies and cognitive science, focusing on a wide range of brain science that spans degenerative brain disease such as dementia, drug delivery and robot development.

"Global companies and advanced countries are making bold investments into robots to rapidly increase their market influence. Experts say Korean companies and the government should foster the robot industry on a long term and systematic basis in order not to be left behind in this new growth engine. Another Samsung Electronics in the robot industry should come from Korea, they say.  Google, Amazon and Softbank are boldly investing into the robot industry, but unfortunately Korean companies seem to use a follower strategy, said Prof. Kwon Dong-soo, Department of Mechanics at KAIST. “The market is very likely to grow exponentially five to 10 years later and it will be difficult to try to catch up that time. We have to be active in investment from now.” “In order to provide a housekeeping robot worth 2 million won, the manufacturer needs an ability to produce more than 10,000 units. Considering this, large companies should be more active,” said Jung Sung-hyun, managing director at Hyundai Heavy Industries. “Considering the explosive growth of the service robot market, Samsung and LG and other large companies accustomed to home appliances will be advantageous.” Standardization for robots is not over and uniqueness and risk-taking should be taken into consideration. Mid-sized companies with a startup culture and financing capability should come forward,” said Kim Kyung-hwan, president of NT Medi.

" Fears are intensifying over contagion of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus within hospitals in South Korea, and yet the authorities are still taking primitive preventive measures against virus and germ. A staff member in a Level-D protective uniform and N95 mask sprays NewGenn disinfectant, scrub beds and floors, and places that patients touched, and then clean up emergency rooms with bleach. The way they do for sanitation is not much different for wards. In the midst of continued spread of the deadly virus especially from hospitals, the risk of viral exposure is not abating. Ultraviolet ray hygiene robot used by the US hospitals can also be developed with Korean robot technologies. Korea possesses superb robot technologies as shown in its winning gold medal in Darpa Robotics Challenge in California, US. However, due to lack of support for and interest in robot research, robot technology development to remove virus is stalled in Korea.

" Strong opposition is serving as a hindrance to the South Korean government`s ambitious plan to outstrip Japan in terms of the self-sufficiency ratio of oil and gas. The plan to increase the self-sufficiency ratio does not take into account economic feasibility and requires the country to pay expensive premiums in purchasing oil or gas fields. A controversy is persisting over the hostile acquisition of DANA, a British oil developer by Korea National Oil Corporation (KNOC) in last September, because KNOC bought the British company for a high price. The acquisition of DANA drove up the country`s oil and gas self-sufficiency ratio by 1.1% points as KNOC secured 244 million barrels of oil. However, criticism is leveled at the one trillion won ($939 million) acquisition. Korea, in reality, is being treated as a minor player by major global resource developers. The problem is that public resource corporations are borrowing astronomical amounts of money to purchase overseas oil and gas fields in order to meet the target self-sufficiency ratio. Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS), Korea Resources Corporation (KORES) and KNOC accumulated 32.8 trillion won in debt last year. The debt is predicted to shoot up to 53.1 trillion won next year, leading the three companies to struggle to pay the borrowing costs, let alone the borrowed money. Some point out that existence of the self-sufficiency ratio undermines capability of Korean resource companies to go abroad to develop resource fields, serving as an obstacle to the country`s mid- and long-term resource development plan. This is because buying a foreign resource company that is in the middle of securing a resource field just to meet the self-sufficiency goal or buying an already developed mine field that is about to start production makes companies difficult to focus their abilities on raising and enhancing their resource development technologies. ""The self-sufficiency ratio has been developed to measure the country`s progress in resource development, just like the inflation rate. It is more crucial to consider economic feasibility than to obsess about the number,"" Lee Chnag-yang Bio Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the KAIST said.

" What the country desperately needs is far-sighted vision to map out long-term outline to build a greener and safer society for universal growth, advised Coalition for Our Common Future (COCF) Chairman Kim Sang-hyup. That eventually would be the new growth engine for the country that could help boost jobs and also plan better for unification, he said. Kim, a veteran journalist-turned advisor on green growth to the president and now heading the COCF, an organization devoted to the issues of climate change, demographic change and the unification of the Korean peninsula, pointed out that on industry level, Korea is ahead with advanced technology in electric battery, energy storage, solar energy, and organic light emitting diode. “The problem is that climate changes and industrial revolution is taking place at a pace beyond our imagination. China is also trailing fast,” he said. Coalition for Our Common Future will co-host the ‘2nd Seoul Climate-Energy Conference’ at JW Marriott Seoul Hotel on Friday with the graduate school of KAIST. “We must take initiative in setting an agenda for green growth that could draw global consensus and creating sustainable future,” he said. Leaders around the world have all been emphasizing the climate agenda this year, underscoring the urgency and significance of the issue. Korea too must come with strong action plan to address problems related to climate changes and encourage green industry. Speakers to the conference include United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is the chairman of Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), and Lee Hoe-sung, chairman of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Mark Lippert, U.S. ambassador to South Korea, will make a speech on policy direction on climate change of the Obama administration while Won Hee-Ryong, governor of Jeju island, will speak on a plan on the ‘2030 carbon free island, Jeju.’ The COCF cited climate change, demographic change and the unification of the Korean peninsula as three factors that would largely influence the future of Korea. “The energy market now encompassing electric cars, ESS, renewable energy and Smart Grid is estimated to grow to be worth $1 trillion by 2020,” he said adding that dominating the market could help the country secure new growth engines, create new jobs and help electricity shortage in North Korea.

" South Korean startup Watcha, which operates local over-the-top media service provider Watcha Play, is seeking to go public on the nation’s secondary Kosdaq bourse. According to sources from the investment banking industry on Thursday, Watcha recently sent a letter to some securities firms in the country to pick an underwriter for its initial public offering (IPO). It will decide the timing of the IPO after forming the underwriting team. Its fund-raising will be used to fuel global outreach. It launched Watcha Global Service in August last year in some English-speaking countries.

The company was founded in 2011 by Park Tae-hoon, a graduate of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), who launched a video content review site Watcha in the following year. It rolled out video streaming service Watcha Play in 2016 to take on the U.S. streaming giant Netflix in the local market and entered into licensing agreements with top six contents providers in Hollywood including HBO, Disney and BBC and 60 or more distributors in Korea including CJ E&M and JTBC.  It had more than 5.7 million subscribers as of early June, increasing almost 10-fold from 640,000 in early 2017. Nearly 70 percent of people remained on its paid subscription service after the free trial ends, much higher than other OTT rivals such as Netflix who on average retain 35 percent to 40 percent of subscribers.

" South Korea, an Internet powerhouse, should put its future on artificial intelligence (AI) development, advised Masayoshi Son, founder and chairman of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. “Japan and Korea both corresponded to AI late compared to China and the United States,” Son said, in a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday, according to officials in company. “… Korea should now put out efforts to become an AI powerhouse.” The meeting between the Japanese billionaire businessman – who is also known to Koreans by his Korean name Son Jung-eui – and Moon was also joined by Moon Gyu-hak, managing partner at Softbank Investment Advisers, You Young-min, science and ICT minister, Park Young-sun, SMEs and startups minister, Noh Young-min, presidential chief of staff, Kim Sang-jo, presidential chief of staff for policy, Lee Ho-seung, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, Kim Hyung-jong, second deputy chief of the National Security Office, Joo Hyung-chul, economic advisor to Moon, and Lee Kong-joo, science and technology adviser. In 1998, Son, an ethnic Korean and founder of Japan’s largest IT investment firm SoftBank, had also met late President Kim Dae-jung. Son proposed to Kim that Korea should keep eyes on broadband, or high-speed Internet network. More than two decades have passed since his last visit to the Blue House and Son this time, instead of high-speed Internet network, emphasized AI development in the era of fourth industrial revolution. “What Korea should focus on is first, second, and third – AI,” Son said, who proposed the country should utmost support on related education, policy, investment, and funding. “AI will bring the highest level of revolution in the history of mankind.” An unnamed official from the Blue House told reporters before the meeting that the president wished to hear Son’s advice in promoting startups as he had shown an eye of finding jewels across the globe. The official also noted that venture investment is an important pillar of innovative growth and that Korea’s new venture investment hit an all-time quarterly high in the first quarter of this year. The number of unicorn firms with value surpassing $1 billion has also jumped from three last year to 9 this year, ranking fifth in the world, the official said. SoftBank Vision Fund (SVF), led by Son, is the largest investor of multinational transportation network company Uber Technologies Inc. that offer ride service hailing, Grab Holdings Inc., the largest ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, and ARM Holdings, a British multinational semiconductor and software design company, among other global innovative firms. Son has been aggressively investing in the mobility sector based on belief that innovation will derive from this industry just as smartphones in the past. Son invested $10 billion in Uber and $1 billion in Grab. Kim Sang-hyup, visiting professor and director at Center for Sustainable Development at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), analyzed that SoftBank is seeking after so-called “BMW strategy,” which stands for Bits (information and communications), Mobility (mobility that connects not only people and products but also money and information), and Watts (renewable energy, battery and power storage system and grid of things). Kim said that mobility will be key to transformation and that Korean companies as well as the government and all workforce should urgently look back on their role and nature of their work so that Korea doesn’t fall behind in the grand mobility revolution. The Blue House official said that the Korean government is also vying to expand research and development and investment in key AI technologies, such as by newly establishing an AI-dedicated graduate school. It is also promoting policies that accelerate convergence between AI and other sectors such as automobiles and energy. In the evening, meanwhile, Son met with Jay. Y Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., Chung Eui-sun, executive vice chairman of Hyundai Motor Co., Koo Kwang-mo, chairman of LG Group, Kim Taek-jin, chief executive of NCSoft Corp., Lee Hae-jin, global investment officer at Naver Corp., and Kim Dong-kwan, executive director at Hanwha Q Cells Co. They are known to have discussed various cooperation measures related to information and communications technology (ICT) sector such as AI, fifth-generation, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle, and mobility, as well as startup ecosystem and investment.

" A newly launched data science graduate program at Seoul National University has attracted talents from hundreds of undergraduate or advanced degree institutions and businesses with various backgrounds at home and abroad, proving the explosive interest in the core technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. South Korea’s most prestigious university did not disclose how many students applied for the Graduate School of Data Science, which will be open in March 2020, but Maeil Business Newspaper confirmed on Sunday that 40 students were accepted out of some 250 applicants. Among matriculating master`s students, five, or 12.5 percent, already hold a master’s degree in other fields than data science, with the remaining university graduates or set to graduate in February. Half of the new admissions majored in two or more disciplines. Eight are female and 32 male. The overall age distribution is wide, from 22 to 42 years. Eight out of 10 are in their 20s. Incoming students came from various undergraduate schools and disciplines with almost no duplication. They include Seoul National University, KAIST, Yonsei University, Hanyang University, Seoul National University of Education, as well as foreign universities such as Cambridge and University College London. Current employees of local companies such as SK Hynix, Naver, and Korea Development Bank, as well as a foreign artificial intelligence company and a foreign university hospital are also confirmed to have join the school. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that. The amount of data in the world is more than doubling every two years, and data scientists analyze and interpret data to help make informed decisions for the betterment of society. Data science, which sits at the intersection of statistics, mathematics, computer and information science, uses scientific methods and algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from big scale data.  Ko Seung-woo, 23, graduated from high school in Korea and received a bachelor`s and master`s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Cambridge, has decided to study at SNU’s Graduate School of Data Science to change his course and work in Korea. Ko who received an admission letter said he plans to finish a doctoral degree and work on interdisciplinary research in the development of a process system in chemical engineering by applying data science. Choi A-young, 23, a transdisciplinary study student in the SNU class of 2015, co-founded a start-up called Geppetto Labs with five colleagues. Named after the creator of Pinocchio, the company is developing an artificial intelligence pet robot that shares emotions and interacts with people. Choi said she wants to study artificial intelligence and deep learning further at the graduate school. Chae Kyu-wook, another student accepted into the course, has worked as a patent lawyer since 2014 after finishing a dual-degree program in physics and statistics at Seoul National University in physics and statistics. He said he wants to refine his data-centric approach and help local SMEs in digital transformation. Lim Jae-young, who works at SK Hynix, said that more than 100 data science experts battle big data problems and research AI technology at his company, adding he will return to SK Hynix after graduation to contribute to making it a leader in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. SNU professor Cha Sang-kyun, who leads the launch of the new graduate school, said the selection of applications for the master’s degree program is true to the purpose of the new school: to encourage students to transcend the boundaries between sciences and humanities through data science.

" Kosdaq-listed Toptec has launched a process to commercialize long-lasting face masks with a nano-fiber filter, a product that can aid dire shortage of face protection against virus. According to industry sources on Wednesday, Toptec located in Asan Techno Valley in Chungnam recently started a pilot run of two mask producing equipment to test safety and defection. The company has survived 11-percent crash in the Kosdaq, with its shares 4.33 percent higher at 10,850 won Thursday after rising almost by its daily limit to 13,350 won in the morning. The company plans to invest 15 billion won ($11.6 million) to install 48 production equipment in a 13,500 square meter site in the industrial zone. The plant’s daily capacity is up to 3 million masks. Chungnam Province expects the company’s capex to create up to 750 new jobs. The company’s hygiene mask features a nanofiber filter which maintains initial filtration efficiency even when exposed to moisture. Unlike conventional non-woven masks which collect pollutants in an electrostatic way, the nano mask uses a method of filtering pollutants through gaps formed by densely arranged nanofibers, making it easier to breathe and durable, the company said. Toptec’s nano-fiber mask is similar to a nano-fiber membrane mask recently developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), which maintains excellent filter efficiency even after being washed. The new nano mask is subject to a regulatory review before commercial production and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is investigating the safety of nano fibers.

" Global pharmaceutical company Sanofi S.A. has joined with South Korea’s top universities to develop immunotherapy drugs. Sanofi-Aventis Korea, the pharmaceutical unit of Sanofi Group, announced on Thursday that it signed an agreement on joint research to develop an immune cell therapy platform with Seoul National University and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The partnership aims to combine a new antibody developed by a research team led by SNU Professor Chung Jun-ho and a new peptide developed a research team led by KAIST Professor Jon Sang-yong with immune cells using immune cell technology from a research team led by Dr. Choi Kyung-ho at College of Medicine, Seoul National University. The new immunotherapy platform will kill cancer cells only, with healthy cells nearby staying safe unlike chemotherapy drugs, Sanofi said. In particular, the new therapy is expected to reduce side effects in patients with liver cancer and other solid cancer and to improve treatment efficacy. Prof. Chung Jun-ho said the goal of the joint research team is to develop immunotherapy drugs that specifically affect cancer cells, while helping prevent the immune system from attacking normal cells in the body. “I am certain the combination of fragmented technologies under the partnership between the Korean academic circle and a global pharmaceutical company will create synergies,” Prof. Jon Sang-yong emphasized. Sanofi will be responsible for clinical trials and commercialization, while supporting the whole process of joint research. The partnership represents the biopharmaceutical industry’s growing trend of open innovation to derive new treatment technology from combining independent research findings of individual labs. Sanofi is the only multinational pharmaceutical company that runs an R&D center for open innovation in Korea. A Sanofi official said its facility in Daedeok Science Town is screening research outcomes from domestic research centers to examine how to create synergies from those achievements. Sanofi signed a 5 trillion won ($4.16 billion) contract last year to commercialize and market Hanmi Pharm products overseas. “It is difficult to maintain innovation with internal R&D activities alone. We will remain active in discovering new bioengineering technology from Korean universities and startups,” the official said.

"South Korea’s space rocket Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), also known as Naro, apparently reached its target altitude following its takeoff Wednesday. The Naro, which lifted off at 4:00 p.m. Wednesday, appears to have reached its target altitude and deployed its payload, the Science and Technology Satellite-2C in nine minutes (540 seconds) after its takeoff. The nation’s Naro Space Center continues to track signals transmitted by the Naro to confirm the space rocket’s speed and altitude. But a full analysis whether the Naro is functioning properly will take more hours. A final judgment will be available around 5:00 a.m. Thursday, 12 to 13 hours after the Naro’s launch, when the satellite makes its first contact with the nation`s ground station at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). A positive interim judgment, however, is available two hours after the Naro’s launch if a receiving station in Norway picks up signals from the Naro. If no issues have been found until this phase, Korea would be joining a club of aerospace technology leaders.

" The creative economy, an initiative that the South Korean government has been pushing forward may generate “zombie companies,” which refer to venture firms that remain in business even though they are technically bankrupt, showed Maeil Business Newspaper’s recent poll. Those polled pointed out the nation needs breakthroughs to prevent the rise of such companies by nurturing promising start-ups and encouraging R&D (Research & Development) activities. Three out of 10 respondents said the creation of ecosystem that nurtures venture companies is the most important element for the creative economy, according to the Maeil Business Newspaper’s poll on the nation’s creative economy conducted Monday. That was followed by enhancing capacity for the nation’s R&D and innovation (22.2 percent) work and creating conditions that value creative ideas and intellectual property (18.8 percent). In other words, establishing such ecosystem is the most urgent task for Korea to achieve the creative economy. “To promote venture and startup activities, there should be a balance between enhancing their capacity and raising the capital for the start-ups,” said Min-hwa Lee, KAIST Professor. “Once such condition is set up, it will be much easier to start venture firms.” As for the reason that Korea lags behind in terms of science and technology capacity, a similar number of respondents cited lack of talent pools in the science (33.9 percent) and R&D activities that only pursue short-term outcome (33.4 percent). The recent poll was based on IDINCU’s innovative mobile research service called Open Survey. The poll covered 700 adults in their 20s to 60s who own their smartphones, and released an analysis in just three hours.

"All of the South Korean governmental information will be disclosed, except for data concerning national security and citizens’ privacy. The scope of public data disclosure is set to expand to include weather, traffic, and geography. As a result, Korea is forecast to see many start-ups in the big data sector.  The Ministry of Security and Public Administration held a ceremony at the Seoul government complex Wednesday, declaring the “Government 3.0” vision. According to the vision, the government will give the public open access to original policy documents that recorded decision-making process and implementation. However, access limitations will be placed on data that contains national security and any information that, if leaked, could harm citizens’ lives, and privacy. The government estimated the number of annual data disclosure would rise from 310,000 last year to 100 million. The public will have access to a wider range of public data, including climate, traffic, geography, patent, welfare and medicine. The government plans to expand the number of open access data categories from the current 2,260 to 6,150 by 2017. The data disclosure by the government will likely trigger a new business model such as big data companies that tap into the open access. According to the National Information Society Agency and KAIST, the open access to governmental data would generate 150,000 new jobs and economic effects worth 24 trillion won ($20.9 billion).

" A Korean research team led by Lee Tae-woo at POSTECH has successfully developed a perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) that could replace LED and organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The research has been conducted in cooperation with British and other Korean scientists, including Prof. Richard H. Friend at the University of Cambridge, Prof. Im Sang-hyuk at Kyung Hee University, Dr. Lee Chang-lyoul and Dr. Myoung No-soung at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology and Prof. Yoo Seung-hyup at KAIST. If commercial production is realized, the new light emitter will be a game changer in the commercial display market dominated by LED and OLED manufacturers. The research findings were published in Science on Friday. LED and OLED displays are widely used in lighting, TVs, mobile phones and other electronic devices due to their low power consumption and high light-emitting efficiency. But expensive OLED emitting materials make it difficult to develop more applications. Other drawbacks include complex color adjustment, and low color purity delivers a limited natural color gamut effect. For these reasons, scientists have been racing to develop new LED materials to overcome OLED limitations. The research team turned its eyes to perovskite that is used in solar cell applications. The cost of perovskite is just one tenth the cost of OLED materials. It has excellent color purity compared to OLED, realizing clear and natural color.

" SK Holdings C&C and IBM Watson have agreed to establish a fund to create an industrial ecosystem to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) research, explore new applications and boost related startups in Korea. The agreement was part of a deal signed in New York last week over SK Holding’s marketing right to use Watson systems in Korea, according to sources on Thursday. The two companies will chip in to raise about $2 million initially to realize their various projects, which include a scholarship program for university and graduate school students in the AI field. Those scholarships will have no strings like compulsory work for SK after graduation, for example. Beneficiaries will also get help finding jobs and utilizing Watson in their research, if necessary. The two companies will soon select beneficiaries from several schools which are actively engaged in AI studies. The most likely candidates include Seoul National University, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and University of Ulsan. SK C&C, a local distributor of IBM’s cognitive computing, launched its Watson-based AI service brand on Wednesday named Aibril. To ensure local AI services due early next year, both companies are now working on Korean-version Watson systems. The company will develop a software program that can analyze conversational Korean language and search data based on machine learning. Watson systems will be located in SK’s Pangyo Cloud Center and users can talk to Watson in Korean via mobile, web or robotic systems. That will allow local software developers and companies to provide AI-based services to the public. The company has been eyeing on the AI business for a long time.

" Korean researchers have developed an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel that can be rolled up like a newspaper and remains highly efficient despite repeated bending, paving the way for the potential application of OLED to wearable monitors or body-worn sensors. The joint research team led by Yoo Seung-hyup, a professor at the School of Electrical Engineering of KAIST, and Lee Tae-woo, a professor at Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering of POSTECH, announced on Thursday they developed a highly efficient, flexible OLED panel that endures repeated bending stresses using graphene, which is called the “dream material.” Currently, flexible OLED technology is used in curved edges of a smartphone and TVs, but they are not truly flexible because their shape is fixed. Flexible OLEDs must be robust enough to meet the real-life demands of end-users and therefore scientists have looked for solutions to maintain OLED performance even after hundreds or thousands of times of folding and unfolding to make a monitor that could be attached to clothes or foldable into a pocket or bag. The research team applied a stack structure consisting of multiple layers of titanium oxides, graphenes and conductive polymers to OLED in order to overcome limitations of light transmission. The resilient titanium oxide can endure a four times higher strain compared with existing transparent oxide electrodes. They also succeeded in increasing the display brightness by maximizing resonance within OLED. Resonance is a phenomenon that shows a strong response to specific frequency windows and laser is a good example of resonance. “If we use an appropriate level of resonance in OLED, it is possible to improve not only efficiency but also the color gamut,” said Professor Yoo.

" A group of Korean scientists announced that it has developed a new type of cathode material for lithium-ion batteries that can be instantly recharged without any impairment on the capacity. A joint team from the Graduate School of Energy, Environment, Water and Sustainability (EEWS) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said Monday its new graphene prototype allows battery recharge within a minute and sharply lengthens battery life as its capacity remains unaffected even after 10,000 recharges. The two-dimensional, atom-scaled lattice carbon sheet called graphen is the common cathode material used for batteries, including lithium-ion batteries that are opted to power smartphones and electric vehicles (EVs) because of their stronger durability and conductivity. However, the method to resolve graphite in a chemical solution and separate ultra-thin sheet of carbon from the solution inevitably leaves traces of foreign material, which can reduce the rate of conductivity and impair battery capacity over time. The research group led by Kang Jeung-ku and Kim Yong-hoon, professors at the Graduate School of EEWS at KAIST, has successfully come up with a novel method by integrating ultrafin titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals - sized 6 nanometers each - with chemical vapor deposition from binder-free macroporous graphene (PG) to make three-dimensional sheet free of impure materials. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. Kang said the integrated structure enhances higher performance in conductivity without any dent on battery capacity. A 130mAh/g capacity battery was fully charged and discharged within just a minute and unaffected even after charges of more than 10,000 times, he added.

" A South Korean startup has developed a smartphone-controlled LED lighting system, allowing users to adjust the intensity and color of lighting with a mobile app through Bluetooth connection. Merlot Laboratories unveiled the product called Merlot Lighting that costs much less to install and is easier to manage than its rival products developed by global giant technology companies that normally cost some million won ($860) for installation and management. The company claimed that the Merlot Lighting is the world’s first smart steer lighting system that can be controlled by a smartphone app. A user of the Merlot Lighting just needs to open the lighting app downloaded to his or her smartphone and move the gauge on the app to control the brightness and color of light in real time. The user can set the white color for the morning and the yellow ambient color for the evening, or make the light dimmer to lull babies to sleep by tapping on the smartphone display. A number of global technology giants have already introduced similar smart lighting systems with adjustable brightness and color, but have failed to lure consumers because of high costs for installation and management. A Philips’ smart steer lighting product, for example, requires a separate remote controller, which is expensive. Color and brightness adjustment is also limited. Smart lamps made by Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. did not receive positive responses due to their high prices, too. Merlot Lab was able to lower the price significantly by independently developing a specific semiconductor chip. The company directly designed the chip and the finished LED lighting product. An LED bulb to be launched in the second half is priced 50 percent lower than existing products made by large companies. The company registered 13 patents on this technology in China and the U.S. It already received 3 billion won from five institutional investors including KB Investment and expects to get another 3 billion won this month. Merlot Lab was co-founded by three engineers graduated from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) who have working experience of 10 to 15 years in integrated circuit development. KAIST is one of Korea’s prestigious universities.

" South Korea’s organ transplant company GenNBio Inc. and its largest shareholder Genexine Inc. announced Wednesday that they have dosed its DNA candidate vaccine GX-19 to non-human primates to evaluate its efficacy in preventing infection from COVID-19. The test came after Genexine formed a consortium with International Vaccine Institute, GenNBio, Binex and prestigious tech schools KAIST and Postech to develop the DNA vaccine GX-19. The vaccine testing in non-human primates will be led by GenNBio. Non-human primates are often considered the best available animal model to evaluate safety and immunogenicity due to their genetic relatedness to humans. An official from Genexine said it aims to begin a human clinical trial as early as June. DNA vaccination is a novel technique that induces adaptive immune responses by injecting genetically engineered plasmid. Shares of GenNBio closed Wednesday 21.13 percent higher at 814 won ($0.66) in the secondary Kosdaq market, and Genexine up 4.86 percent at 53,900 won.

" South Korea’s Bioneer Corp. is expanding its presence and poised for further growth in the molecular diagnostic assay market, which has been traditionally dominated by large foreign companies. The company is now flooded with orders from around the world for its proprietary RT-PCR molecular diagnostic equipment for COVID-19. Monthly exports of such equipment are 2 to 3 times as large as total exports achieved throughout last year, Bioneer CEO Park Han-oh told Maeil Business Newspaper in a recent interview. Park said the company has sold about 150 units in Korea and 1,000 overseas, carving out more than 5 percent of the global molecular diagnostic assay market. Bioneer’s diagnostic equipment and reagents have been actively introduced to local diagnosis service companies, life science businesses, and hospitals, generating an import replacement effect worth nearly 1 trillion won, Park claimed. Still, the local market is monopolized by multinational pharmaceutical companies like Roche and Abbott, but their assays are expensive enough to reach $150,000 to $350,000 per unit. Bioneer is the only Korean company that has successfully localized such expensive diagnostic equipment. It also manufactures diagnostic reagents. Most of the companies that have received European certification (CE-IVD) in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, hepatitis B and C infection and AIDS are multinational companies, but Bioneere is the only Asian company that has obtained all of these certifications, Park said.  Bioneer is also developing a COVID-1919 therapy that can neutralize the virus by breaking a specific RNA-protein interaction with siRNA synthesized with its own DNA synthesis technology. “Based on our DNA synthesis technology, we made 980 types of candidate molecules to fight COVID-19 faster than anyone in the world,"" Park said, adding animal testing will begin from early June. A therapy for preventing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 patients was already tested in animal models and will be evaluated in human clinical trials within this year. This will be a first-in-class drug with a totally different mechanism of action that targets DNA sequences, Park said. Park, who received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), founded Bioneer in 1992, the first biotech venture in Korea. He was the first researcher-turned-businessman from the state-run science research organization where he studied DNA synthesis technology. Inspired by DNA polymerase technology developed by Dr. Kwon Suk-tae, a Korean expert thermostable DNA polymerase, he established the company to to distribute Korea`s unique PCR technology around the world by combining Dr. Kwon’s technology and his DNA synthesis technology. After the foundation, his business came to fruition quickly. PCR diagnostic products that replicate target genes into hundreds of millions of genes in one or two hours became popular in domestic hospitals, research institutes, and laboratories. It took at least a month to get a new product from overseas, but Bioneer’s localized PCR products allowed many domestic companies to get job done immediately. In 2002, the company developed an RT-PCR assay named ExStation Series, which marked the first in Asia that can amplify genes in real time and can detect target genes with a probability of over 99 percent. “It is an assay that is sensitive enough to detect contamination with a drop of blood in a large pool of water,” said Park. This assay was deployed as a biological weapon detection system against bioterrorism during the Korea-Japan World Cup. During the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, Bioneer`s automatic systems to extract DNA and RNA along with about 150 units of its RT-PCR assays were up and running to carry out testing on a large scale. Founded in 1992, Bioneer operates a head office for both research and production in Daejeon and a factory in Cheongju.

" South Korea whose testing and treatment response to coronavirus outbreak gained international recognition and envy is readying to establish a set of quarantine standard package to readily address to new virus challenges. The standards span from reusable, self-sanitizing facial masks and protection gears to faster testing kits and data-analyzed control over patients. Reusable masks developed by Kim Il-doo, a professor from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), will be released to the market as soon as the safety regarding residual materials and fabric separation is proved. The masks do not lose their protective qualities even after being washed more than 20 times. KAIST professor Chung Ki-hoon is developing a technology to significantly cut the testing time from the average 6 hours to less than 3 hours by reducing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing time from 60 minutes to three minutes and 30 seconds.  Han dong-soo, a KAIST professor of Electric Engineering Department, is working on a smartphone app that stores information of users’ whereabouts for two weeks and automatically discards the data after two weeks. He said his study of more than 10 years could be effectively used in a virus outbreak to minimize damage. The country’s leading technology institute is also seeking to develop movable negative pressure rooms to make it easy to transfer patients via cars, airplanes and ships, and offer them to where they are most needed, according to Hwang Sung-woong, a KAIST researcher. Fast commercialization of the inventions is the key to Korea’s readiness against future virus assaults. Bae Choong-sik, dean of college of engineering at KAIST, said that the institute will look for market demands and companies that are willing to invest in the technologies to launch the products as soon as possible.

" The Nature Index has cast a spotlight on South Korea’s scientific power with its Nature Supplement on Thursday, crediting ICT technology and government’s R&D push behind the country’s success in the common universal battle with COVID-19. The Nature Index compiled by Springer Nature, the publisher of Nature, is a database of author affiliation information collected from research articles published in an independently selected group of 82 high-quality science journals. It is extraordinary for the publication to have a close look at Korea’s entire scientific landscape since its focus on the country’s Institute for Basic Science (IBS). In an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper, David Swinbanks, Founder of the Nature Index and Chairman of Springer Nature, Australia & New Zealand, said he expects Korea will receive international attention a lot through the special edition, adding ""the Korean government is eagerly investing in R&D, and we felt the need to analyze the effect of this investment.” The articles written by three Nature Index reporters said the fundamental background behind Korea`s rapid response to COVID-19 was strong government-directed R&D spending. As a percentage of gross domestic product, South Korea’s spending on R&D is 4.5 percent as of 2018, second only to Israel’s 4.9 percent. Based on this combined with its ICT power, Korea was able to launch a detailed epidemiological study of COVID-19 patients and commercialize test kits rapidly. South Korea is also outstanding in personnel exchanges between academia and industry, the articles reported, adding that three out of every 1,000 academics were transferred from industry to academia between 2017 and 2019, which is the highest level in the world. In the proportion of academics who went from academia to industry, Korea ranked sixth among the world’s top 10 research powers selected by the Nature Index. The proportion of researchers who have relocated to South Korea from other countries in the past three years is also higher than the global average, suggesting that the country’s drive to end its comparative scientific isolation may be bearing fruit, the publication said. Author affiliations in the League of Scholars data set show that 4.3–4.9 percent of all researchers in South Korea had moved from abroad between 2017 and 2020, whether foreign-born researchers relocating from elsewhere, or those returning home after working abroad, according to the Nature Index. This is higher than the global average of 3.7 percent. The report also noted that Korea is the most active in physics research compared to the United States, China and Japan. According to the Nature Index’s analysis, Korea has the highest proportion of physics among the four countries in the Nature Index ranking, which indicates the proportion of thesis topics by research field. The overall ranking of domestic research institutes was Seoul National University, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), IBS, Yonsei University, Sungkyunkwan University, and Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). However, the environment in which creative research is difficult was pointed out as a limitation of the Korean scientific community. Typical examples include relative alienation of basic science research, evaluation systems based on paper quantity not quality, and research projects and budget from government-funded research institutes. In the 1970s and 1980s, companies such as IBM and Bell Laboratories did a lot in basic science research, said Swinbanks, advising large Korean companies such as Samsung should make long-term investment in basic science research.

" Nanotechnology-based brain tumor therapy project has been chosen among this year’s 28 research projects subject to Samsung Electronics R&D sponsorship. Samsung Electronics Co. on Thursday picked 28 research projects that will benefit its 38.8 billion won ($31.9 million) financial support in total as part of its commitment to facilitating the development of future technologies in the field of natural science, materials and information communications. The tech giant in 2013 launched the support program for the development of future technologies with a goal to inject a total of 1.5 trillion won for 10 years. Program beneficiaries are announced three times a year, and this year’s first winners are 28 projects – 14 in natural science, eight in materials and six in information communications. In the ICT sector, a project led by Choy Young-bin, biomedical engineering professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine, will be supported to develop nano technology-based therapeutic strategies against brain tumors with an aim to minimize the surgery risks with minimally invasive brain surgery. Another project headed by Min H.

" An independent policy advisory panel has recommended Seoul National University (SNU) to create School of Entrepreneurship and Innovation (SEI), demanding the country’s top university be more inclusive of secular business cults beyond pure academic pursuits. SNU is the most prestigious university in Korea but remains behind other local universities in business creation. Korea University, another elite institution, has run a program called π-Ville to support business creation by students since 2016. Seven Korean universities already introduced a graduate school course related to business creation. Universities like Sungkyunkwan University and Chung Ang University have offered a state-assisted master`s and doctoral degree program in business creation. KAIST, Korea’s top-ranked research-oriented science and engineering institution, also followed suit in 2016, providing scientific research and practical entrepreneurship education at the same time. According to a report from the panel, leading overseas universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University of Michigan, Stanford University and Harvard University are all active in entrepreneurship education. MIT has worked closely with business schools and engineering colleges to serve as a mecca for entrepreneurship and innovation, fostering over 30,000 companies as of 2015. Those companies now have as many as 4.6 million employees in total and generate 2,000 trillion won ($1,644 billion) in annual sales. Until now, Seoul National University had a negative perception of business creation as it focuses more on academic achievements than on profit taking. However, Park Won-woo, an SNU business school professor, who is in charge of the report, said, business creation does not just mean doing business and making money, adding that it also means realizing the dream of social contribution through value creation based on innovation and convergence. Since non-profit organization or social enterprising is also related to business creation as a way to realize dreams, it is possible to start entrepreneurship in all academic fields of Seoul National University, the professor explained, and this is based on entrepreneurship, which refers to innovative thinking and willingness to create new values. The panel aims to finalize the plan to establish a school for business creation and obtain the approval of the education ministry this year with a goal of the start of classes in the first semester in 2022.

" Korean researchers have discovered an important biomarker to determine the severity of COVID-19, raising hope for a treatment to improve symptoms by using a glucocorticoid inhibitor like dexamethasone. A KAIST research team led by Prof. Lee Heung-hyu at Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering said on Monday it found the severity of COVID-19 is determined by overactivation of innate immune cell neutrophils in white blood cells, citing neutrophils and glucocorticoid hormones that regulate body functions are linked to each other. The team analyzed single-cell genetic information in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 infection. This information is shared through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The researchers found that severe COVID-19 was caused by overactivation of neutrophils, whose importance in viral infections was less known compared to the case of fungal and bacterial infections. In particular, the research team found that the influx of neutrophils increases due to chemokines expressed in bone marrow-derived immune cells such as macrophages. Chemokines are a group of secreted proteins within the cytokine family involved in leukocyte chemoattraction and trafficking of immune cells. The research team said that the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in immune cells derived from bone marrow leads to the influx of neutrophils and their activation. COVID-19 symptoms vary from patient to patient, and it is important to predict the severity of each patient for treatment. To determine the seriousness, a reliable biomarker is required. Patients with severe COVID-19 show symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe damage to the lung tissue. In response, various immune cells such as neutrophils exhibit an immune response to protect the host from viral infection. However, an excessive immune response like a cytokine storm or an excessive inflammatory reaction can damage organs. The study results were published in the online edition of Frontiers in Immunology on Aug. 28.

"The World Knowledge Forum (WKF) will provide a session this year that gives opportunities to learn from top-notch gurus the core of internet governance that still sounds tricky even after explanations, such as net neutrality, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  This year, the WKF has arranged a session where the Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG)’s members will become speakers for the general public. The session is one of open sessions, an ambitious project of the 15th WKF that went through a makeover of the prior forums and starts its brand new second chapter. The WKF successfully incorporated the session when the GCIG’s members unanimously accepted such offer from Maekyung Media Group’s chairman Chang Dae-hwan during the first official meeting of the GCIG. So far, the following speakers have confirmed their attendance: Carl Bildt, chair of the GCIC and Swedish minister for foreign affairs; Laura DeNardis, professor at American University and; Gordon Smith, distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. The session is expected to feature intriguing discussions, as it will be presided by Chon Kil-nam, honorary professor at KAIST and a so-called ‘father of internet in South Korea’. The session’s discussions are forecast to mainly deal with how the internet governance will affect lives of ordinary citizens. “Through the open session, we will ensure that discussions are conducted at a level on par with the general public so that participants can clearly understand the importance of internet governance,” the GCIG said. The session will mostly cover transfer of internet address control and net neutrality, which would immediately grab the attention from the general public. The ICANN, which has managed the internet address system so far, decided to transfer its authority to a new institution from September of next year. This comes on the heels of a flood of criticism from other countries that the ICANN is under the US Department of Commerce. Stakeholders are in a tug of war over which institution will take over the address management function. The 2014 ITU Plenipotentiary Conference, which convenes immediately after the WKF, is also expected to focus on the issue. Net neutrality refers to the principle that the transmission of information over the internet should be treated equally regardless of who sends or receives it. In recent days, in some countries such as the US, a movement is emerging that individuals or organizations that pay more should be given access to a faster internet. Anyone who wants to participate in the session can click the Like button on the WKF’s Facebook page (facebook.com/WorldKnowledgeForum) from today and join the event of asking questions to speakers. In other words, prospective participants can write their questions as comments on the post about respective speaker on the Facebook page, which uploads a post that introduces a speaker every day. A writer of a comment picked as the best question will be given an opportunity to partake in the open session. Besides, regular subscribers to the Maekyung e-Newspaper will be randomly selected for an opportunity to attend the open session.

"The more addicted to smartphones, the more likely for users to use one to two apps most frequently and spend at least four hours a day on using their phones, according to the latest research. A team of researchers led by professor of knowledge service engineering Lee Eu-jin at the KAIST said Sunday they developed a system that analyzes smartphone usage records to detect and identify traits of the addicts to smartphones.  The research team divided 95 college students into an at-risk group of 36 and no-risk group of 59 based on the National Information Society Agency’s guideline for adults on self-evaluation of addiction to smartphone. Then the team collected and analyzed records spanning 50,000 hours of usage including turning on and off smartphones, status of screen and battery, running apps, surfing the internet and phone calls and texts. The research revealed those in the at-risk group repeatedly used one to two apps, and most of them were mobile messengers like the “KakaoTalk” and SNS including the “Facebook” and “Twitter.” Apps’ notification function was closely linked with the addictive behavior as well. The at-risk group’s daily average usage time extended by another 38 minutes when the notification function for the KakaoTalk’s messages and new replies on SNS was turned on. Notification messages stimulated the at-risk users with a lower self-control capacity, causing them to often use smartphones. Based on such data, the researchers developed a system, which automatically diagnose whether smartphone users are at risk of addiction or not. The system demonstrated more than 80 percent accuracy rate. “We are developing an app that helps users stop using smartphone excessively,” said professor Lee.

""We made a prototype using a 3D printer at school, but it was inconvenient to use, so we wanted to develop a new 3D printer for everybody,” said Seo. A considerable amount of major parts of their 3D printer is independently developed to reduce costs. A metal bearing inside the printer was replaced by a plastic one to reduce noise. They changed the printing method, too. Most of currently available 3D printers build up an object horizontally, but the new one adopted a vertically building method. Their outcome was a great success. It costs only one third the price of previous products for the same performance. The new 3D printer’s retail price is set at the 900,000 won range.

"3D printer, which was known to be used for specific purpose in industrial fields, is coming close to our daily lives. This comes mainly as patents related to 3D printers held by foreign companies were expired successively and, in turn, many companies are jumping into the market. Also, low-end 3D printers were released with prices less than one million won ($898). Some even predicts that the era of ‘one 3D printer for one household’ is coming like one document printer owned by a household in the past.  Dozens of 3D printers were unveiled in South Korea. However, a few of them were chosen by customers. US companies such as Stratasys and 3D Systems are dominating the advanced 3D printer market while Korean companies and other overseas firms are making fierce competition in low-end 3D printers. Korea’s small and mid-sized companies including High Vision System and Opencreators are gaining the upper hand with competitive prices. The 3D printer of about 900,000 won developed by KAIST students became the subject much talked about because of more than 100 pre-orders before the launch. According to the data of Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, the local 3D printer market, whose scale has been 30 billion won in 2012, developed into 42 billion won market last year and 59 billion won market this year and is expected to become 116 billion market. This is 40 percent annual growth rate, twice the forecast of 20 percent growth rate for the world 3D printer market released by Wohlers Associates, a US market research firm.

" An industrial dispute over the origin of botox (botulinum toxin) may develop into a court battle. Medytox Inc. unveiled the base sequence of its toxin widely used for beauty and cosmetic injections to minimize wrinkles, challenging its local rivals to do same after it claimed the base toxin strain of Daewoong Pharm Co. exactly matched its Clostridium botulinum type A Hall strain. Daewoong Pharm Co. and Hugel Inc. charging theirs have been extracted from natural resources as soil and food waste, questioned the legitimacy of the toxin source in the Medytox neurotoxin agents and reportedly have embarked on legal study to a court battle. Daewoong Pharm president Lee Jong-wook said Thursday ""Medytox should receive validation by authorities with supporting evidence of its toxin source, instead of sticking to the release of the DNA base sequence of the toxin. Lee said several study results related to botox were published in the 1990s and Daewoong Pharm’s Nabota was officially approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare with all related materials to support its product, disputing Medytox’ argument that the odds to discover a botox in the soil is as low as to win the lottery. Lee also said Medytox’ toxin strain claiming to have come from the University of Wisconsin must be validated, saying “the toxin has been suspected of being brought in illegally. I don’t understand how medical products manufactured with that toxin were officially approved."" Hugel CEO Moon Kyung-yeop said on Tuesday that ""As a scientist, I want to ask Medytox CEO and scientist Jung Hyun-ho whether the botox origin is that important,” arguing that key technology does not lie in the toxin itself but the protein purification technology. Moon said ""Botox is a bacterium found in a natural setting, especially in decomposed land or food so that material or manufacturing patent cannot be filed. The protein purification technology to turn this bacterium into a drug varies from company to company and this technology is a proprietary protocol of each manufacturer.” Moon graduated received a Ph.D. in molecular biology from Seoul National University and served as a research associate professor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and a research professor at KAIST. Since 2001 when he founded Hugel, he collected 2,000 decay-prone samples and repeated culture and identification processes to find CBFC26, a botox which has high productivity, and he studied optimal protein purification technology and freezing dry technology for five years before his commercial success. “We submitted all supporting materials for regulatory approval to the MFDS so the issue surrounding the toxin origin is not an essential matter. The toxin brought in from Wisconsin University’s lab also originated from decomposed food or soil and this is a common sense,” Moon added.

" Will machines be friends or foes to humans in the future? That was the question robotic and artificial intelligence engineers and researchers debated during the session of Human and Robot Coexistence at the World Knowledge Forum on Thursday. Dennis Hong, a professor of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who had swept the RoboCup championships, an annual international robotics competition, from 2011 to 2015 and one of 10 young geniuses selected by U.S. science magazine Popular Science, projected humanoid robots would be rather evolved into ones that can fill in jobs in areas that humans can not accomplish or pet-like robots. Hong said he is currently conducting studies on applications for humanoids in disaster recovery and management. With current technology, it is yet impossible to develop robots that could either coexist like fellow human friends or confront humans, said Oh Jun-ho, a professor of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) who developed Korea’s first humanoid robot Hubo. The stunning win by Google DeepMind`s AlphaGo, Go playing software based on deep machine learning, against the best living traditional Go player Lee Se-dol last year has spurred fears among some people that robots could excel what had been believed uniquely human realm with ability to learn and think on their own. People should prepare for the era where robots can coexist with people, another worldly renowned robot researcher argued. Hiroshi Ishiguro, a professor of Osaka University who has conducted researches on AI robots, said that robots are no longer simple machines providing assistance to humans in industrial fields as they are ready to jump into people’s daily lives providing comfort and companionship. The professor has been chosen as one of 100 living geniuses by Creators Synectics, a U.K.-based consulting firm.

" A South Korean research team has developed a new air sterilization technology that is said to be effective in eradicating Covid-19 virus without producing health hazardous substances. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said on Wednesday that a research team led by Professor Lee Seung-seob of Mechanical Engineering has developed a new electrospray technology that can create micro water droplets with a sterilization effect on Covid-19. The Korean team’s electrospray technology creates micro water droplets that contain OH radical sterilization substance. OH radical is a substance that has the strong sterilization effects but is harmless to humans. OH radical is short-lived in the air. But when it is locked inside water droplets, it can live longer.  The micro water droplet spray technology containing OH radical was first developed by Japan’s Panasonic. In July, Panasonic announced a test result showing that micro water droplets based on electrospray technology is effective in killing coronavirus. However, it has drawbacks of producing only a small amount of micro water droplets and creating harmful ozone. But the Korean team’s technology that uses micro nozzle made of polymer to spray electrostatic can create a large amount of micro water droplets without producing ozone. Using its water electrospray technology and polymer micro nozzle, the team is currently developing an antiseptic air purifier for Covid-19. “The polymer micro-fine nozzle electrospray technology is harmless to the human body and environmentally-friendly, which is expected to contribute to prevention of Covid-19 in the future,” said Lee. The research was first introduced in international journal Polymer in April.                                                                                                            ",S.

" The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said Monday its joint research team has identified how the novel coronavirus destroys lung cells with a lab-based 3D mini-organ culture technique developed to mirror the physiology and pathology of human lung alveolar cells, the major target of Covid-19 infection. The research team led by KAIST professor Ju Young-seok found the virus proliferated rapidly within six hours of exposure, while it took about three days for an innate immune response to the infection. Researchers also found a single virus particle could be enough to infect one cell and that some cells drastically lost their function on the third day of infection. For this experiment, the research team newly established a 3D model of human alveolar cells that can be cultured continuously, which can help other researchers to characterize the pathogenesis of Covid-19 and other respiratory pathogens. Prof. Ju said the scalable 3D model can help research on various respiratory viral infections and will accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments as animal tests can be skipped. The research was co-conducted by Prof. Lee Joo-hyeon from University of Cambridge, and other professors and scientists from Korea National Institute of Health, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul National University Hospital and Korean startup GENOMEinSIGHT.

"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) reformed its faculty administration through a strict tenure screening process. It was surprising that near half the professors were tagged disqualified in the tenure screening. Such reformation is both shocking and refreshing considering that the Korean society is currently infected with the inveterate disease “equalitarianism.” Thus, the university and its professors deserve a big round of applause for attempting a true reformation. University faculty society is the highest intellectual clique in the Korean society, but the group has recently been spotlighted in criticism for shielding its survival sans competition using vested rights. Harsh denouncements against Korean society’s blinded appraisal for academic background, especially stirred by former professor Shin Jeong-ah’s fabricated degree, are not entirely irrelevant from the staled society of professors either. Yet, the professors’ society in Korean has changed substantially from the past. The time is gone when individuals can hang on to their professor title for a lifetime without writing proper dissertations. Nowadays, if an individual fails to fulfill a dissertation quota, he or she is neglected from their colleagues. This is because unlike the past, market principles are activated in academia. Consequently, incidents have occurred where professors were excluded from promotion from assistant professor to associate professor to full-time professor. However, the reformation scale in KAIST is completely different. According to the significantly intensified screening standard, 15 out of 35 professors were judged unqualified. This does not mean that the unsuccessful 15 have to immediately pack and leave. Nevertheless, the fact so many unqualified professors were sieved out in the first screening process from an institute rumored to hold an almost intimidating research culture, means that the screening process played an extremely substantial role, not a perfunctory one. Instead of sifting out one or two professors, a system that provokes competition within the faculty society has been introduced. It is yet unclear whether the KAIST’s experiment will be a success in the end. It could simply end up as a storm in a teacup if participation by a wider Korean society does not ensue. There are many cases in the Korean society where the negative creates the positive. This is because praises are only given in words without follow-up actions. For the Korean society to develop, the chronic disease of equalitarianism must be cured first. Hence, it is urgent that KAIST’s reformation experiment is spread out to the Korean society including other universities as well as the government and corporations.

"Only two Korean universities managed to squeeze in the Top 200 World University Ranking tallied by UK’s THES (The Times Higher Education Supplement) and recruitment consultant QS; Seoul National University (SNU, 51st) and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST, 132nd). SNU leaped 12 ranks and KAIST 66 in a year but they still lack much behind not only prestigious British and American universities but also chief Asian universities such as the University of Tokyo (17th), University of Hong Kong (18th), National University of Singapore (33rd) and Beijing University (36th). Other Korean universities that were unsuccessful in being enlisted in the Top 200 cannot even dare step onto the international arena. However, such disgraceful results are far from what the recent World Economic Forum’s (WEF) global competitiveness index asserts. Korea ranked 11th in global competitiveness and 6th in higher education and training. However, unlike the WEF survey which takes into consideration various sub-criteria including attendance, the THES-QS survey mirrors corporate evaluation of universities’ research abilities and students’ capabilities, more accurately depicting the present competitiveness of Korean universities. If Korea’s education quality is not significantly upgraded via self-regulation and competition, its economic competitiveness will inevitably plunge. Nevertheless, the Korean government fails to escape from the dogma of regimental education standardization and cannot even break the chain of corruption relating to university admissions.

"Seoul National University (SNU) has joined the reformation wave sweeping through Korea’s professoriate. 10 out of 39 SNU associate professors screened for full professorship and tenure were disqualified. The failure rate for tenure at domestic institutions had been near zero once professors reached mainstream university faculty, away from individual departments or colleges. Juxtaposed to the convention, this recent shuffle is a historical event. The shock of a failed promotion could be greater for professors especially in the humanities and social sciences fields. Signs of reformation recently spreading fast over domestic university campuses are both welcoming and proper turn of events. KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is still the trailblazer, disqualifying a bunch of professors in the tenure screening, ousting professors with poor research achievements, employing and newly recruiting competent professors. Yonsei University, Korea University, Sogang University, Sungkyunkwan University and Hanyang University are also to join the move or already in progress. SNU partaking in the move under such circumstances holds a significant meaning. As the institution at the pinnacle of Korea’s higher education makes a move, its influence on other schools will be inevitable. KAIST’s reformation could have been refreshing but SNU’s decision has realigned the future general trend for Korean campuses.

QUESTION 2: My evaluation as a media professional is that you are good at getting messages across to the listeners even though your voice might get a little raspy from time to time ANSWER: My voice is a bit different from others. I understand that it is not the ideal voice for broadcasting, which I regret, but many people can now recognize my voice. They say, 밫hat뭩 the President.� That is an upside to having a unique voice. On my part, it is my sincere heart, rather than my voice, that I would like to convey to the people. Thus, I am making steady efforts with the conviction that people will understand my intentions. QUESTION 3: I have a question that people are most anxious to ask. When do you think ordinary citizens will be able to break free from this suffocating economic crisis and regain their smiles? ANSWER: Well, I think most leaders around the world may be receiving this kind of question from their people as all nations are in dire economic difficulties. Whenever heads of state meet together, they all have the same concern. However, is there any leader of any nation who can give a definite answer to this question? That is the point that I feel so much concern about. Some well-to-do people may heap criticism on me now, but the people from low-income families that I met on a grass-roots tour of many places held my hands and shed tears, imploring me to revive the economy as quickly as possible. They asked me to help relieve the heavy burdens on their shoulders. While doing so, they even comforted me, the President. I felt so sorry for them and, at the same time, thankful. I was truly impressed by them, indeed. What is all the more regrettable is the fact that ordinary citizens are bound to bear the brunt of hardships whenever a crisis sets in뾲he bigger the business, the slower the reaction. By the time the economy turns around, however, large conglomerates and mid-sized companies benefit from the recovery earlier than ordinary citizens. Many countries now praise Korea for having made the most effective response to the crisis. Many experts also say that Korea will achieve the highest growth among OECD member nations next year. Even with this kind of compliments, our response must be cautious. Some argue that we need to brace ourselves for what will come next by putting in place a so-called exit strategy. I think, however, it is too early to do so. My view is that we need to further our efforts to achieve more growth. The surest answer I can give is that Korea뭩 economy is recovering faster than any other country even though I cannot say when the economy will turn around. I expect that in Korea, ordinary citizens will be able to benefit earlier than in other countries. QUESTION 4: You have said that the Government would consider granting amnesty on the August 15 Liberation Day to those from low-income families convicted of petty crimes. How many do you expect will be included on the list? ANSWER: An amnesty is now under discussion. The Liberation Day amnesty this time will be focused on those from low-income families to stabilize their lives. Some people request that business leaders and civil servants be pardoned, but the Liberation Day amnesty will be granted exclusively to ordinary citizens like farmers, fishermen and self-employed persons. The Government is particularly trying to find and pardon those who have had their driver뭩 licenses revoked while driving to support their families. By doing so, the Government will be able to provide support to them in eking out a living. The beneficiaries of the exclusive amnesty will amount to about 1.5 million people, including fishermen, farmers, small-scale business owners and those who have had their driver뭩 licenses revoked. All of them, with no exception, will be granted amnesty this time. I hope they will be able to take heart a little from the Government amnesty and get off to a new start for the future. QUESTION 5: It is true that in addition to current economic difficulties, the burden on household budgets stemming from private tutoring costs is staggering, indeed. The Government recently announced a ban on late-night classes at private institutes, but some pointed out that such a step is nothing but a stopgap measure. Do you have more fundamental measures in the making to tackle the problem? ANSWER: Without detailed action plans, fundamental measures alone will not be able to address the problems. Fundamental solutions together with follow-up measures will work to prevent any side effects in practical terms. I want to make it clear that students should be able to go to whatever colleges they want only with a public education without any help of private tutoring or institutes. It can뭪 happen overnight, but that is the way it should be. The Government is now working toward that direction, but the general public has yet to realize it. Parents are still hesitant to put their trust in the Government, suspecting that only their children may end up losing out by depending on public education alone. I believe that many universities, especially the prestigious colleges people desire to attend, will recruit their students through a college admission officer system without administering an essay test starting next year. They will also give more chances to students from provincial regions such as farming and fishing communities. Beginning next year, KAIST and POSTEC will recruit all their students through interviews without administering an essay test. According to statistics released by Seoul National University and several other colleges that had recruited students from farming and fishing communities in provincial areas, students from those regions lagged behind their counterparts from cities during the first and second years, but they began to catch up with advanced students from the third year toward graduation, and some of them even did better than them. It is an amazing result. What is more astonishing is the fact that those college graduates who had never had private tutoring are pulling off outstanding performances in the so-called decent jobs. Impressed by this, businesses have started to prefer those kinds of graduates and ask colleges to send such students to them. This trend, in turn, makes universities think twice about the system in a positive light saying, 밫hat is the way we should follow.� Education should not only aim at encouraging students to study harder. Rather, its focus has to be placed on character building, fostering of a cooperative attitude and understanding of other people. In addition, it also has to teach how to have an appreciative mind towards others, express appreciation to parents and teachers and understand social issues. The door of universities has to open wide to those students who have received such an education. Then, high schools in rural areas will be able to produce excellent students and become prestigious schools, which could be likened to the proverbial case of 밶 dragon rising from a creek.� As a result, parents would decide that their children do not need any private tutoring뾲he goal the Government intends to realize without fail. This will happen soon. Starting next year, most universities will adopt the new admission system. In addition, I expect that around the end of my term in office, the admission procedures of most universities would fully conform to the newly introduced system. If such a new system is actually applied next year, the public would be able to trust what the Government is promising to do. QUESTION 6: The highly controversial media reform bills have passed the National Assembly. A controversy still remains concerning the legitimacy of the voting procedures. The opposition parties claim that there is an intention to control the media. Taking this opportunity, would you share your views on the domestic media? ANSWER: The control of the broadcast media and the press by any administration has become a thing of the past. I personally do not want media organizations to simply report in favor of my Administration. In addition, such a lopsided coverage will never occur in the future. What I want the media to do is to help relay facts to the general public through impartial broadcasting. This fundamental function of the media will not be compromised because of any systemic change. The convergence between broadcasting and telecommunications will help spawn many novel technologies, a trend that is pursued by many countries across the globe. When it comes to competition with other countries in this sector, Korea has the upper hand thanks to its advanced IT. However, the absence of a relevant legal framework has so far constituted a stumbling block in expediting such a move, a matter of grave concern to me. On the basis of its advanced technological prowess, it is necessary for the Republic to set up a standard in the area of convergence between broadcasting and telecommunications, thus helping to create decent jobs. It would have been great if the ruling and opposition parties could have reached an agreement on the bills in the National Assembly. However, a decision on the issue could not be postponed any longer. I am not going to comment on what happened in the National Assembly. What I want to stress rather is the fact that we will lose our chances if we are too late. This is not an issue that has to be interpreted from a political or ideological perspective. The whole world is paying attention to this issue. Many countries have already embarked on a reform of the media laws, and thus, it is highly likely that they see what is happening in Korea regarding the laws as something extraordinary. This is based on what I have seen crisscrossing the world. In this regard, I hope that my fellow Koreans will understand the issue from such a perspective. Eventually, I am sure they will understand it that way. QUESTION 7: In a previous radio address, you mentioned taking fundamental measures. Many people wonder what that means. It has caused a lot of talk concerning a cabinet reshuffle and reorganization of Cheong Wa Dae. Do you have any personnel reorganization plan during your second year in office? ANSWER: Experts from various sectors will be making assessments of possible fundamental measures. Korea has to move in a direction that will help further progress. In addition, I am committed to humbly accepting what the general public wants. If Korean society becomes divided into a dichotomy, it would be impossible to take even a single step forward. In the National Assembly, the practice of one party unconditionally opposing what the other party is planning to do has to come to an end. At least, it is necessary to engage in deliberations on an issue from a middle-of-the-road or neutral perspective. I believe that is what the people want. The fundamental measures are not about replacing some officials. Rather, they have something to do with national policies and the direction of their implementation. Previous administrations have resorted to personnel replacements in the face of political adversities under the guise of reform or a changeover in state affairs. That could sometimes be helpful politically for a while, but it could also deal a serious blow to government affairs. These days, this is all the more so since the domestic and overseas affairs of the government are closely intertwined. In the case of the economy minister, the domestic and overseas duties are about fifty-fifty. Of course, there might be some people who need to be replaced for the goal of expediting progress. Rather than just a change for change뭩 sake, such a personnel replacement has to be pursued with the aim of improving efficiency or obtaining a better outcome. However, it is not in the interest of our country in this day and age to carry out personnel replacements and to make scapegoats of those who are leaving in order to escape from a politically difficult situation. As of now, Korea holds a remarkable standing in the international community. To my great surprise, the Republic is respected and recognized highly for its capabilities. That said, personnel administration has to match the nation뭩 elevated status. To put it another way, personnel management should not be carried out only for domestic political goals. One fundamental measure is to pay attention to the various voices of the people and reflect them in the implementation of policies. The Government is to unveil what the fundamental measures are by taking action one by one. It is not planning to carry out sudden personnel replacements without taking any proper preparations. Accordingly, if the public understands that actions taken one after another by the Government are policies for low-income families in line with middle-of-the-road pragmatism and that fundamental measures are being put into practice by the Government, it would greatly encourage me in fulfilling my duties. QUESTION 8: You have recently donated assets worth 33.1 billion won, which were amassed over your lifetime. What is your hope in connection with the donation? ANSWER: The donation has just recently been carried out, but I made up mind long ago. My family was so poor that I could not attend school, and I had to sell things on the street. At that time, my mother taught me the invaluable lesson that I had to help those less fortunate as much as possible when the situation allowed me to do so. When I left the business world, I made up my mind to donate my assets, which was made very clear in my book published in 1995. Since then, I have always thought of how to carry out the donation without causing any political misunderstanding. After becoming President, I did not have any motive to use it for any specific political purpose. I wanted to put my idea into action at an appropriate time so as not to cause misunderstanding. This helped give my family and me a new lease on life. The donation was not aimed at urging the people to follow the suit of the President. It was to keep my word, a course I had to follow. Nevertheless, especially when times are tough, it is necessary for leading businesses in the nation and the people from various social classes to give more serious consideration to making donations if the country is to join the ranks of advanced nations. A rise in the GNP and GDP is not sufficient for a country to become an advanced nation. QUESTION 9: Mr. President, this is the 20th Radio & Internet Address. Do you have any final comments for the people? ANSWER: I could hardly recognize that this was the 20th address. I have always wanted to share what is in my mind through the radio address. I hope that my fellow citizens will be able to appreciate my true intentions. For my part, I will do my best to serve the public. If all of you encourage my Administration, we would be able to fulfill our duties with redoubled courage at home and abroad. The Korean people have truly great potential. I will do my utmost to lay the groundwork for the great prosperity of everyone. Thank you very much. ANCHOR: Thank you very much, Mr. President. This concludes the dialogue with the President prepared on the occasion of the 20th Radio and Internet Address to the Nation. Thank you all!

"GS Caltex and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) announced on December 21 that they developed new technology that can mass produce biofuel from straw bale and waste wood.  The technology was jointly developed by GS Caltex’s technology research center and the research team led by distinguished professor Lee Sang-yeop, according to GS Catlex. Once the technology is commercialized, it will be able to churn out the most amount of biofuel or a blend of bio alcohol in the world from non-edible biomass. A blend of bioalcohol is a biofuel consisting alcohol substance mainly ISO-PROPANOL, butanol and ethanol. It also has a higher number of octane number than butanol. Another one of its strength is the energy density higher than ethanol. The newly developed technology improves strains used for fermenting butanol through metabolic engineering. Metabolic engineering refers to technology that enables a developer to modify characteristic of cells through molecular biology and chemistry engineering. Once the technology is applied, a blend of bioalcohol with high mobility than the existing production process using clostridium will be produced. Furthermore, the process will cut production costs as the technology does not require isolating and processing the by-product or acetone.

"The South Korean government unveiled revision of Sejong City focused on education, science and business away from the original aim of building a complex administrative city. The revision newly added an international science business belt participated by four large companies- Samsung, Lotte, Hanwha and Woongjin Group- while scrapping plans to relocate administrative bodies namely nine ministries and four state agencies. This is part of an initiative to create a business belt to connect Sejong- Daeduk- Osong- Ochang. The revision, however, is expected to face a raging opposition from the ruling party, as well as the opposition party such as the Democratic Party and Liberty Forward Party in the process of passing the revision at the National Assembly.  South Korean Prime Minister Chung Un-chan announced the revision in the Korea Central Government Complex in Sejongro on the morning of January 11. According to the revision, the size of land reserved for corporations, universities and research institutions has tripled from 4.86 million㎡ (6.7 percent of total capacity) to 15.08 million㎡ (20.7 percent) to help enhance self-sufficiency. The peripheral land next to the plot reserved for governmental body as envisioned in the original plan has been designated as international science-business belt. Here, basic science research labs, convergence research centers, heavy ion colliders, international science graduate schools are to be established. Moreover, Samsung Group decided to set up businesses on thin film solar cell, fuel cell for generation, bio healthcare, LED, Data processing and call center. Hanwha Group is to set up energy business, Woongjin Group an integrated research center and Lotte Group a food research lab. Austria’s solar power company SSF has also finalized a plan to enter the city. New campuses of the prestigious Korea University and KAIST are to be located in the city as well. The size of investment has been expanded as well to 16.5 trillion won with 8.5 trillion won from government’s budget, 3.5 trillion won in budget for the international science business belt and corporate investment of 4.5 trillion won. If the government can stick to the plan, the new city is projected to triple the effect of job creation than the original plan.

" When I visited Seoul in 2004, for a conference that my university was hosting, I had the chance to listen to a distinguished professor of KAIST Business School expounding on S. Korea`s initiative to become the business hub of North East Asia, especially in finance and logistics. It was an exciting vision put forth, very ambitious and fraught with implementation challenges, but nevertheless very bold. That is when I decided to bring my US MBA students to Seoul every year to educate them on Korean history and culture and its impact on Korean companies and how business is done in Korea. With these visits, I started noticing how sophisticated Korean companies had become in their product and service offerings. Even in the US, products of Korean companies (like Samsung and LG cell phones, LCD TVs and home appliances), in large retail stores like Best Buy, Home Depot and Sears were being premium priced and showcased advanced technology. But if you asked a common American about Samsung, he might comment ""Isn`t that a Japanese company?"" The economic success of Korea luckily has been noticed distinctly in political circles. Who would have imagined that Korea that was mired in the IMF crisis of 1997 and had to be bailed out by the IMF to the tune of $40 billion (which it paid back in record time) will be hosting the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in 2010! G20 economies comprise more than 85% of the global GNP, two-thirds of the world population and around 80% of the global trade-these are the most powerful economies of the world and their financial experts will congregate in Seoul to discuss and plan on important issues such as coordinated strategies to manage the current stage of the 2008 financial crisis and the overriding objective of achieving a sustainable growth and development with financial stability. Korea has a lot to teach the developed countries, especially in financial crisis management, from its successful experience in managing the IMF crisis as well as the current global financial meltdown from which it has emerged successfully (with a projected growth rate of more than 4.5% in 2010). Developing countries, similarly, have a lot to learn from Korea in the way it has developed its economy (from $79 per capita income in 1960 to almost $20,000 now) as well as its globally successful companies. Korea should host conferences and seminars on financial crisis management (using educational institutions such as KAIST`s Graduate School of Finance, which was created by the generous funding and support from the government) and invite global financial economists/bankers to participate. Similarly, workshops and roundtables should be organized on stable economic growth stably and developing global enterprises, inviting development economists/policy strategists/ corporate executives. Obviously, Korean experts should be key-note speakers at such events and highlight successful strategies and lessons to be learnt from the Korean experience. Now is the time, in the limelight of the G20 year, to build Brand Korea. Nagaja!

"Maeil Business Newspaper (MBN) is found as a business newspaper most preferred by South Korean university students. University News Network (UNN) and Campus Life, an Internet portal site, surveyed preference of business newspapers to 1,700 university students from about 200 four-year universities in South Korea for 15-day period from September 1 and said October 12 that 45 percent of surveyed students have selected MBN as the most favorite. MBN revealed a wide gap with Hankook Business Newspaper (12.2 percent) and Herald Business (11.4 percent) in the survey. “This year was no exception that Maeil Business Newspaper was again selected as the No.1 business newspaper among students. Its outstanding portion, as high as 45 percent, absolutely does not leave chances to win for other business newspapers,” UNN explained. The Hankyoreh and MBC each topped list of a general daily newspaper and television station. Samsung brand topped the survey on the most favored corporate image, and POSCO followed. The most preferred product brands were as following -- search portal: Naver, mobile services: SK Telecom, multiplex theater: CGV, department store: Lotte Department Store, printer: Hewlett-Packard (HP). Han Bi-ya, a travel writer and relief worker, Ahn Chul-soo, a professor at the KAIST and Roh Moo-hyun, a former president were named as the most respected South Koreans. Barrack Omaba, the U.S. president and Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft and Ophra Winfrey were found to be most respected figures outside the country.
