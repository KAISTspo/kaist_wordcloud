"A South Korean university is launching a new department in cooperation with Samsung Electronics to nurture future talent in the field of system chips. Yonsei University said Thursday it would open a system chip engineering department starting from the class of 2021, in partnership with Samsung Electronics. The undergraduate program, funded by South Korea’s biggest chipmaker, is designed to educate future talent under the condition that all students will be hired by the company as soon as they graduate.  The new department will have 50 students each year, and they will all be granted scholarships from Samsung Electronics, according to the university’s plan reported to the Education Ministry.Yonsei and Samsung will review further plans of setting up follow-up courses at graduate schools, it added. Other chipmakers, including SK hynix, are reportedly in talks to launch system chip engineering programs at Seoul National University and KAIST.These new programs specializing in system chip development come amid a growing need for chipmakers to expand their presence in the non-memory market. Samsung and SK hynix are respectively the largest and second-largest memory chipmakers in the world, but they have an insignificant presence in the non-memory market, which accounts for 70 percent of the chip business. The announcement has drawn mixed reactions. Some support the idea of resolving the chronic shortage of experts in the semiconductor field, while others have raised concerns over academia losing its independence from corporate control.

"SEOGWIPO, Jeju Island -- The resort island of Jeju is striving to be the global benchmark for sustainable development with its carbon-free project that includes plans to boost the use of renewable energy and eco-friendly vehicles, according to Jeju Special Self-Governing Province Gov. Won Hee-ryong.Won, who has used three electric vehicles since taking office in 2014, holds the honorary status of being the first provincial governor to use an official green car.“The change from gasoline cars to EVs has the effect of saving over 4 million won ($3,400) on average per year for an annual run of 24,000 kilometers,” Won told The Korea Herald in a recent interview. “This is the same as cutting down 3.9 tons of CO2 and planting 28 trees,” he said, adding that the lack of noise when driving an EV helps him focus better on brainstorming for his policies. Jeju Island was selected in 2011 by the central government to lead the EV industry development in South Korea. The following year in 2012, it launched the Carbon Free Island 2030 project (CFI 2030) and gave unlimited financial support to the EV industry. As a result, the number of green cars registered in Jeju marked 16,352 as of December 2018, taking up more than one-third of Korea’s total number of registered green cars -- 36,835 as of end-June 2018. Including the charging stations installed at individual homes, Jeju had 14,108 charging stations as of December 2018. The rate of charging stations per cars registered reaches over 90 percent.With an EV charging station every 3.5 kilometers, the island boasts one of the best infrastructure for EVs. But visitors still complain about the lack of “open” charging stations at public parking lots. As of August 2018, Jeju had 1,103 open express chargers that require 30 minutes to an hour for a full recharge, and 344 slow chargers, which fully recharge overnight. A 26-year-old Seoul resident Kim Hee-hyen told The Korea Herald recently that she “had to spend a good amount of my weekend visit to Jeju searching for the nearest available charging station.” While there are plenty of charging stations, the problem lies in the relatively long time that EVs take to recharge. During the often hourlong endeavor, drivers leave their cars unattended, and by the time their vehicles are done charging, the drivers aren’t present to vacate the spot quickly enough for the next user. To alleviate the issue of people hogging charging stations, the authorities has started levying a fee at the open charging stations that have been free to use so far. A do-not-disturb-charging law -- penalties on those who leave their charging vehicle unattended after it is fully charged -- is being implemented.The move, like many other fledgling policies, has run into opposition. Jang Jae-ahn, 38, for instance said he was put off to learn that seven out of every 10 people who took out EV rentals ended up paying 100,000 won fine for hogging the charging station after their vehicles were fully charged. He otherwise was advised to wait near the car for the full hour it took for charging to be completed. This is a disadvantage although the rental service offers benefits such as a refueling charge in the form of a credit card to lease an EV.Jeju aspires to solve this issue by equipping the island with a total of 17,770 charging stations this year. “We will require car rental operators to rent out fully charged EVs, and install more charging stations at major tourist sites and at accommodations,“ Gov. Won said.A comprehensive EV service system incorporating mobile smart applications for real-time information on availability of charging stations, signboards on roads, and hotline for difficulties while operating EVs are other resolutions that are being pushed forward.  Coinciding with the sixth annual International Electric Vehicle Expo in Jeju, the city announced it will inject 129 billion won in four years for newly designated regulatory sandbox areas. The fund comprises of the central government’s contribution of 61 billion won, Jeju government’s 31 billion won and private sector investments amounting to 38 billion won. The areas to be covered by the regulatory sandbox include the advanced science technology district in Ara-dong, Jeju National University, Jeju South Korea Polytechnic University campus, Jeju International University and the Jeju Innovation City area in the island’s southern half of Seogwipo.“My vision is to make Jeju a sustainable city based on clean, renewable energy,” said Won. The province has so far been heavily dependent on agro-fishery business involving regional specialty tangerines and seafood, as well as tourism-focused accommodation and retail services. With its aquamarine-colored shores and Hallasan, the tallest mountain in Korea, the region attracted approximately 14 million visitors in 2018. This was despite the reduction of foreign visitors due to a temporary fallout with China following US’ deployment of THAAD anti-missile defense system in Korea.The city has always felt the need to develop more areas of business for sustainability.“Jeju has the ideal conditions to foster green energy businesses, as it is rich in natural resources, wind and solar energy,” Won said, “We are working for a harmonious expansion of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ with existing industries.”The government has vowed to replace all energy consumption on the island by 2030 to wind-generated electricity, and other forms of renewable energy. All cars will be replaced with EVs. The carbon-free island project has four main pillars of EV, renewable energy, smart city and smart grid. The project received attention from various countries for its potential of being applicable to some 2,400 cities around the globe. “For EVs, not only the direction but also the timing is critical. We must dominate the market faster than other global players,” Won said, adding that he hopes that others will benchmark Jeju’s success. The city is collaborating with Korea’s leading technology university KAIST for a specially established research institute that focuses on electric and autonomous vehicles, as well as connecting with other players in the industry for commercialization. “Seoul, Daegu and cities in the Gyeonggi Province can benchmark our case,” said Won, “What we are doing here can serve as a textbook for the other cities looking to expand their EV market.” Jeju wishes to work together with the Netherlands and France for wind-generated renewable energy and carbon-free technologies. “Jeju will share its know-how with other global players including North Korea,” said Won, “We will actively take part in international associations to decrease pollution on a worldwide scale.” The government proposes to encourage commercial EV charging service industry, improve the infrastructure of open charging stations and increase the number of stations for the disabled. The city is also working to build an energy storage system center before the end of this year, and a hybrid renewable EV charging station that will make use of blockchain technology to store and manage EV battery usage.

"From a student’s perspective, tech-savvy South Korea might be just the place to make a promising start as an entrepreneur.But it also has its limits, despite the unprecedented level of support and attention being paid to the startup ecosystem here, according to Korean students who took part in a two-day hackathon in Finland in June, jointly organized by the Seoul-based Korea Startup Forum and Helsinki-based Junction.Three of them sat down with The Korea Herald to talk about what’s happening in the startup community.Kim So-young, 22, was part of a team at the hackathon called HyvaCC, which came in second for developing an innovative gamification method of getting people to pick up trash. Chang Joon-hyuk, 23, invented an app called Arles, which tracks the symptoms of depression with a “smart mirror.” Seo Hyun-sun, 31, won the top prize with Jubilee, a team dedicated to location-based health monitoring and tracking solution for senior citizens.Below are some excerpts from the interview.Seo: I’m a graduate student in the Master of Entrepreneurship & Innovation program at KAIST, and I spent over a decade studying and working overseas. I’m leading two projects -- Jubilee and a personalized beauty platform called Candid. I have an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. After graduating from college and interning at Siemens Healthcare, I came back to Korea to build a career as an entrepreneur.Kim: I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, clothing and textiles from Yonsei University. In college, I joined a club for startup entrepreneurs. Then I went to study textile engineering in Germany. I am now interested in how textile engineering can be applied to wearable devices. Chang: I’m a former UI/UX designer and product manager. Arles is an idea I have much affection for, but we decided to put it on hold. Currently, I am leading the team behind Travelous, a real-time, location-based meetup app for travelers.Seo: I found that Korea and Finland have a lot in common. For instance, both the countries are dedicated to providing financial support and networking channels for young entrepreneurs.Kim: I was amazed by the size of the exhibition run by students in Finland. Also, I learned about how community builders like Slush, Junction and Startup Sauna were influencing the world.Chang: I was not aware of a startup boom in Finland until I got there. Even in remote areas, people recognized me as a participant in a startup event. I haven’t seen this much interest in the startup community.Seo: Our mentor told us that open communication is crucial, because no one can be good at everything. I was told that as a leader, it’s important for me to identify the strength of each individual team member and designate adequate roles to them.Kim: Our team was divided, so our mentor suggested ways to incorporate our ideas through candid discussions or a vote. He also said teamwork comes before ideation.Chang: Our mentors helped us realize what we were missing out in the idealization process and solidify our business model.Kim: As an engineering major, I met and worked with many people who wanted to create their own tech startups. But the thing is, there are still risks involved for engineer-only startups, despite the seamless technology. I think engineers tend to take branding, sales and marketing efforts lightly. On campus, I was given a lot of proposals for patent applications and opportunities to meet mentors. On the other hand, I had little chance to learn what I should be mindful of when commercializing technology and building teamwork. Chang: There are classes in Korea run by consultants on how to craft, revise and execute plans for launching new products. These classes help minimize risks for entrepreneurs. Seo: Flexibility. I learned that an early-stage entrepreneur should learn how to take criticism in a positive way. Lean approach helps the entrepreneur grow, and their business too.Kim: Knowing who can be a good partner in your business. Unless you are in a one-off project, finding a good partner is the most crucial part, especially finding one with a “good” personality.Chang: Versatility. Being a jack-of-all-trades will help make the entrepreneur a better asset to the team. Seo: Korea has a well-established network for tech-powered startups. But success does not come easy unless you put yourself out there. Kim: Universities in Korea have a great tech base and students perform very well. Still, I doubt that they encourage entrepreneurship, in terms of administrative and financial support. It’s time for universities to turn themselves into beacons of opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs, when they get lost and do not know where to go.Chang: There are a number of support programs, especially for Korean university students, that serve as sandboxes for early stage entrepreneurs.

"KAIST, South Korea’s top science and technology university, on Thursday rebutted claims that it was contributing to the development of artificial intelligence-powered killer robots, which had prompted over 50 of the world’s top AI researchers to announce a boycott of KAIST.“I am saddened to hear about the announcement on the boycott of KAIST for allegedly developing killer robots,” KAIST President Shin Sung-chul said in a public statement.“I would like to reaffirm that KAIST does not have any intention to engage in development of lethal autonomous weapons system and killer robots. KAIST is significantly aware of ethical concerns in the application of all technologies including artificial intelligence.”KAIST’s statement comes a day after more than 50 leading AI and robotics experts from 30 countries announced a boycott of KAIST, after the university opened what they claimed was an AI weapons lab with Hanwha Systems, one of Korea’s top two makers of cluster munitions.The KAIST president explained that the research center at KAIST, which was opened in collaboration with Hanwha Systems, does not intend to develop any lethal autonomous weapons systems and that the research actions do not target individual attacks.Rather, the center aims to develop algorithms on efficient logistical systems, unmanned navigation and aviation training systems. KAIST will be responsible for educating researchers and providing consultation.“As an academic institution, we value human rights and ethical standards to a very high degree. KAIST has strived to conduct research for better serving the world,” Shin said.The boycott against KAIST was organized by professor Toby Walsh from the University of South Wales, ahead of a United Nations meeting in Geneva on April 9 aimed at discussing the challenges of lethal autonomous weapons.The researchers included in the boycott had sent KAIST a letter saying that they would sever ties with the Korean university until it provides reassurances that the weaponry it develops will have “meaningful human control.”“At a time when the United Nations is discussing how to contain the threat posed to international security by autonomous weapons, it is regrettable that a prestigious institution like KAIST looks to accelerate the arms race to develop such weapons,” the letter reads.“We can see prototypes of autonomous weapons under development today by many nations including the US, China, Russia, and the UK. We are locked into an arms race that no one wants to happen. KAIST’s actions will only accelerate this arms race. We cannot tolerate this.” KAIST said that it has informed the members of the boycott of its formal stance on the issue via email, and that it had received responses from some who have thanked the university for clarifying the allegations.

"Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong met Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in Seoul to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in areas including artificial intelligence and cloud-computing technology, according to industry sources Wednesday.During the meeting, the two agreed to expand their partnership in technologies critical to future growth, including AI, cloud-computing services, data-center operations, 5G networks and software development, Samsung Electronics said. Microsoft Korea declined to comment on the meeting, including its content and purpose.The extended partnership will likely be centered on cloud services, considering Microsoft’s “Mobile First, Cloud First” strategy. It also suggests a potential increase in cloud-related supply contracts between the two companies, said an industry source who declined to be named. “Given that high-density memory chips and SSDs are integral to delivering optimal cloud services, Samsung’s supply of semiconductors for cloud servers to Microsoft is expected to increase. Samsung’s products will also employ more of Microsoft’s cloud services,” the source said.  Microsoft and Samsung are already working together in the cloud business. During his keynote speech at Wednesday’s conference, Nadella cited Samsung’s smart air conditioners as an example of how Microsoft’s intelligent cloud platform Azure is being used to collect and analyze data, enabling products to run on internet of things technology.In Korea for the first time since assuming his post in 2014, the Microsoft CEO called on companies and organizations here to aggressively pursue digital transformation to stay competitive in a world where computing is becoming ubiquitous. He said Korean firms should embrace “tech intensity” -- the ability to quickly adopt the latest technologies while building digital capabilities of their own -- and stressed Microsoft’s readiness to assist clients in doing so. “It’s all about your technology and your tech intensity. We want to build technology so that you can go on to build on more technology. It’s as simple as that,” Nadella said, touching down on the company’s founding mission -- to empower firms to do more with technology.As part of such efforts, Microsoft is building Azure -- its intelligent cloud-computing platform -- as the “world’s first computer.” With data centers in 54 global regions, including two in Korea, the US software giant is “building tremendous capability worldwide” so that applications can be started and deployed anywhere, said the chief.With the massive computing infrastructure and resources at its disposal, Microsoft is also advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities, achieving milestones such as being the first to achieve human parity in AI-powered machine translation. And such AI capabilities have been made available to clients through Azure.“We are making these (AI) technologies available as a set of services that can be extended, so that everyone can incorporate them as applications. That’s what Azure AI does: the best vision, speech-language processing capacities and also fantastic computing structure so that you have the capability to build your own AI,” he said.Many Korean companies are already doing this, using Microsoft’s solutions. In addition to Samsung Electronics, Korea’s game company Pearl Abyss -- behind the hit game “Black Desert” -- uses Azure to service its games and collect the metadata needed to improve the game’s operations. 356MC is using Azure’s machine-learning solutions to develop AI systems to assist surgeries, while CarDoc uses Azure AI to automatically detect damage to a vehicle by analyzing images. Meanwhile, KAIST is building predictive power to assess traffic conditions and prevent road accidents using Azure. The Microsoft chief also stressed the importance of cybersecurity, privacy and ethics in building AI systems, saying not just “what computers can do, but also what computers should do” were important considerations in AI development.By Sohn Ji-young ()","Samsung chief meets Microsoft CEO on forging deeper cloud, AI partnership",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181107000738&ACE_SEARCH=1

"South Korea’s top science and technology university KAIST has called on the South Korean government to expand its financial support for the institute, as it seeks to strengthen its research and training programs and help Korea remain competitive in the new age of technology-driven economies.KAIST on Monday unveiled its “2031 vision” road map, which includes an action plan to innovate its academic training, pave new research areas, encourage more tech-driven entrepreneurship and build a more globalized presence. In doing so, KAIST hopes to become the first Korean academic institution to be included among the world’s top 10 universities by 2031. The Korean university’s ranking currently hovers at around 41st.“The execution of our 2031 vision hinges on whether we can secure sufficient resources. Given this, we plan to carefully but aggressively seek expanded funding from now on,” said KAIST President Shin Sung-chul during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. KAIST is foremost turning to the government to back its efforts. Government financing now accounts for 25 percent of KAIST’s total budget. The university hopes to raise this to 30 percent by 2031, according to Shin.On top of state funding, KAIST will work to secure additional funds by investing in tech startups founded by its graduates and reaping returns, as well as pooling more donations from its alumni community.With the new funding, KAIST is seeking to nearly triple its budget from this year’s 859 billion won ($870 million) to 2.03 trillion won in 2031. Without a major budget increase, KAIST will find it increasingly difficult to remain competitive against rival universities in Asia, particularly those in China, Shin said.Over the past few years, China’s science and technology universities have quickly grown in stature on the back of massive funding from the government, outranking older players like KAIST.With a growing sense of urgency, KAIST has embraced its 2031 vision, which will seek improvements and innovation on five fronts: education, research, tech-driven entrepreneurship, globalization and future strategizing.In terms of education, KAIST will focus on nurturing creative leaders. To do so, it will work on diversifying its pool of students, by increasing the percentage of students it accepts from non-science focused high schools by 5 percent annually. It will also raise the percentage of foreign students accepted into the university from 8.4 percent to 15 percent by 2021, and to 30 percent by 2031. For undergraduates, KAIST will create interdisciplinary programs that merge multiple areas of studies. It will further offer more online courses teaching new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analysis to those already working in the industry.On the research innovation front, KAIST will push for a collaborative research system in which junior and senior professors pursue joint research in order to ensure that research can be sustained and improved over generations. Benchmarking the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Korean university also plans to raise the number of professors it hires from 676 in 2018 to 1,243 in 2031, with 30 percent of the faculty being non-Koreans.To better focus its resources, KAIST has also set aside 10 technology research areas to focus on in the next decade. They include hyperphotonics, neural networks for artificial intelligence systems, biotechnology and health care, new energy and next-generation defense technologies, among others.Encouraging entrepreneurship is another area of focus for KAIST. It plans to expand its ongoing efforts to encourage students to apply their research toward building new, useful products, through establishing larger venture support programs. There were around 1,456 startups founded by KAIST alumni as of 2018. Together, they created around 32,000 jobs and raised a total of 13.6 trillion won in revenue, according to the university. On the globalization front, KAIST plans to build an additional global campus in Seoul and another one in an overseas location, forging strategic ties between KAIST’s main Daejeon campus and international locations.It also will pursue more joint research with other universities abroad, while helping third-world countries build their own science and technology institutes by benchmarking KAIST.As for its future strategy push, KAIST will open a new think tank dedicated to researching future technology and economic trends. It has already partnered with the World Economic Forum to jointly conduct research on the challenges and changes expected to come from the “fourth industrial revolution.”Meanwhile, KAIST said it will hold a formal ceremony announcing its new 2031 vision at its main campus in Daejeon on March 20.By Sohn Ji-young ()","KAIST seeks expanded state funding for science, tech leadership vision",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180313000620&ACE_SEARCH=1
"FinTech, which by definition is adding technology to finance, does not refer to just one type of technology. When we talk about FinTech, technologies like blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence and electronic currency are also mentioned. FinTech is an aggregation of various technologies; however, each technology is evolving day by day. FinTech is being recognized as a representative technological innovation symbolizing our time. Until now, human civilization has been developed by technological innovation. Technological innovation has been the engine to produce new products and thus, new products have created new markets and inevitably a new world. By looking at automobiles, which were invented just over 100 years ago to replace horse-drawn carriages, or smartphones, which became mainstream 10 years ago when line telephones were the general trend, the world we live in now can be clearly distinguished as pre- and post- technological innovation.Changes created by technologies are new and can be surprising at first. However, as time passes, such changes become infused into everyday life, and such initial surprise becomes dull. If FinTech claims itself as a technological innovation, the future of FinTech can be quite obvious. Now, customers are excited over the new business models that come with using FinTech, such as easily transferring money overseas and not having to use certificates on an account transfer.However, as time passes and FinTech as a technology permeates into the activities and habits of our everyday life, customers will become oblivious to using it. As we breathe naturally without recognizing the existence of oxygen at every moment, customers may organically use the business models of FinTech without even noticing. When this time comes, the term FinTech will also be refined to be understood as a typical, conventional technology.Customers from all demographics are uninterested in technology itself. For customers, their happiness is the only importance. The customers’ only concern is how much their lives improve with technology. That is to say, it is much more important that there is no fee rather than not having to use certificates for account transfers.From the point of view of companies, FinTech is a technological innovation that leads the next business models; however, from the point of view of consumers, FinTech must not be a technological innovation -- FinTech must be the means to bring happiness to consumers. Therefore, the direction that FinTech should aim for must target service innovation.Service innovation understands technology from the consumers’ perspective and selects suitable technologies to fulfill consumers’ happiness. Further, it improves the inconvenience, dissatisfaction and anxiety that consumers face, particularly surrounding financial services. It must be the objective of FinTech to solve these negative elements with the power of innovative financial technologies and provide satisfaction to customers.For instance, no matter how technologies have been developed, financial fraud schemes, such as voice phishing, are still at large. Even those with great financial knowledge and social experiences can become victims of voice phishing. As technology develops, cyber criminals collect big data and choose their targets using artificial intelligence. The deceived targets then easily send money with electronic currency using smartphones. During this fraudulent process, both the criminal and its victim use the new technologies of FinTech. By the time the victim realizes what is happening, it is usually too late -- the money is gone without a trace. There is always lingering danger during the processes of cash deposits, withdrawals and transfers between accounts.However, despite these dangers everyone must use finance. The technology used in the process of financial fraud is FinTech; however, the technology to protect consumers should also be FinTech. Undoubtedly, FinTech must aim for service innovation. After the direction of FinTech is set, which is to succeed via service innovation, consumers must participate during every process of such innovation. If companies force their customers to use FinTech from only the viewpoint of technology, a new market cannot be created. Without input from customers, FinTech alone will never be enough to change the world. Technologies and business models that fail to truly address the needs of consumers is just a storm in a teacup.By Yoon Tae-sung Yoon Tae-sung is a visiting professor at School of Business and Technology Management and Graduate Program for Innovation & Technology Management in KAIST. -- Ed.","[Contribution] Even for FinTech, it comes down to happiness",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171201000864&ACE_SEARCH=1

"Samsung Electronics’ smartphone sales are predicted to see the slowest growth next year among the top five smartphone makers, reaching a market share of below 20 percent, according to the US research firm on Thursday. According to Strategy Analytics, the Korean tech giant is predicted to have a 20.5 percent market share this year with shipment of around 319 million units. Next year, the firm will see its share fall to 19.2 percent, with shipment dropping to 315 million units, SA predicted on the grounds that the competition will be fiercer with Apple’s premium phones and Chinese firms’ budget smartphones. This is the first time that Samsung will see its annual smartphone shipment decrease since its Galaxy S series was first launched in 2010 -- with the exception of last year’s fire-prone Note 7 debacle which resulted in 300 million units being shipped with a 20.8 percent market share. Other companies in the top five list -- Apple, Huawei, Oppo and Xiomi -- are predicted to maintain their market share or see growth next year, the report said. Apple’s share is expected to rise from 14 percent to 14.3 percent, with its shipment set increase from 218 million units to 234 million units next year. The third largest smartphone maker Huawei is projected to reach 10 percent both this year and next year, with its shipment increasing to 164 million units next year from 156 million units. Oppo is expected to have a 7.8 percent share this year and next year while Xiaomi is predicted to see its share rise to 7.4 percent from 6.1 percent during the same period. Samsung needs to seek a breakthrough as the Chinese smartphone makers are unprecedentedly solidifying their positions in emerging markets, including China and India, with their low-cost yet quality products, according to industry watchers. “Since successful Chinese firms are expanding their presence in the fast-growing, budget smartphone markets, Samsung’s global presence will further shrink unless it secures competitiveness against Chinese firms,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST College of Business.By Shin Ji-hye ()",Samsung smartphone to slow in growth in 2018: SA,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171214000747&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Anticipation is rising over Samsung’s foldable smartphone, with concept images and videos of the so-called Galaxy X making the rounds every month. However, industry insiders are cautious about the high expectations, saying there are still many unaddressed technical challenges. A new concept video of the Galaxy X from US tech media outlet Tech Configuration caught attention Wednesday. It showed that the device’s 5-inch display can be used as a normal smartphone in the folded mode and as an 8-inch tablet when unfolded.This is just the latest of many stories that have emerged in recent years. A series of concept images, videos and patents have fueled speculation that the new foldable phone will be unveiled soon. And lending weight to the rumor were remarks by Samsung’s mobile division chief Koh Dong-Jin in September. At a media conference, the chief said “We are targeting to launch foldable phones next year, although we are in the process of overcoming some hurdles for mass production.”The remarks caused a stir in the industry, but insiders appeared doubtful that foldable phones would be launched next year. “It is quite unlikely we will see the mass production of foldable phones next year due to unaddressed technical challenges,” a source familiar with the matter said. Another industry insider cited issues related to durability, such as ensuring the device can be folded and unfolded many times, and costs involved in making the device thinner. However, even if the foldable smartphone is not produced next year, Samsung still faces saturation in both the market and innovation in one of its mainstays, smartphones. It will have to make efforts to develop new phones, according to industry watchers. The global mobile phone has seen slow growth in recent years. The market is expected to see sales of around 1.82 billion units this year down from 1.89 billion units last year, according to Gartner. The figure is expected to slightly increase to 1.92 billion units next year. Samsung will for the first time see its market share fall to 19.2 percent next year from a 20.5 percent share this year, with shipments dropping to 315 million units from 319 million units, Strategy Analytics predicted, citing fiercer competition with Apple’s premium phones and Chinese firms’ budget smartphones. “The biggest fear for tech firms is to see consumers no longer want to change their devices so they will keep innovating both hardware and software,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST College of Business.“The foldable phones matter to Samsung to satisfy the needs of consumers whose appetite for bigger screens -- yet in small sizes -- appears endless,” he added.

"DAEJEON -- The Daejeon Creative Economy Innovation Center, jointly established by SK Group and the South Korean government in a bid to nurture local start-ups, is helping to accelerate the growth and expansion of promising venture firms.Located at KAIST, one of Korea’s most prestigious universities focused on science and technology research and development, the center opened its doors in October 2014 aiming to help information and communications technology-focused start-ups commercialize their technology and expand their businesses globally.The 10 start-ups participating in the center’s inaugural Dream Venture Star program Thursday presented their achievements to high officials, investors and reporters, following 10 months of one-on-one business mentorship and marketing support led by SK and the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. “Our job was essentially to help venture firms develop solutions that match customers’ needs and turn those solutions into innovative technology which can create high profits,” said Cho Sung-ju, a KAIST professor and author of national best seller “Lean Startup Bible,” who served as a program mentor.The 10 firms have managed to attract more than 3.3 billion won ($2.8 million) in investments and record around 1.8 billion won in sales, a significant improvement from just 320 million won in sales posted prior to partaking in the program, according to SK Group.CMES -- the developer of a 3-D industrial scanner able to detect software defects more successfully than a 2-D device -- has secured a 100 million won deal to service its products to German-based automobile parts company Continental.“Engineering start-ups typically lack starting capital and entrepreneurship skills,” said Lee Sung-ho, head of CMES. “SK provided us with seed money as well as helpful business mentorship related to technology management in general.”The company is reportedly set to close a 1 billion won deal with a major Korean automobile manufacturer and to begin servicing its 3-D scanners to semiconductor manufacturer SK Hynix in the near future as well. TEGway, the developer of the world’s first wearable sensors able to generate power using body heat, won a Netexplo award in February, given by UNESCO to the world’s top 10 digital innovations every year. The venture firm has also signed a 1 billion won investment deal with Korea Science & Technology Holdings. VideoFactory, a cloud-based online video platform provider led by 25-year-old CEO Hwang Min-young, was selected to join the F50 Private Founder & Investment Network through a Silicon Valley program run by the Science Ministry’s Korea Innovation Center.“With support from the F50 network, we have been taking part in closed meetings with high-profile U.S. investors such as Google,” Hwang said, adding that Coolidge Corner Investment has agreed to invest 450 million won in investment in the video tech start-up.After the entrepreneurship program concludes in August, the 10 start-ups are set to continue cooperating with SK Group. For instance, SK Telecom plans to join hands with fintech start-up C&TECH to commercialize the venture firm’s securities management program. The telecom giant is also planning to apply EXSEN’s advanced gas sensor modules to its portable air-monitoring device Air Cube while SK Hynix is looking to install the venture firm’s modules in its Cheongju plant.“Together with SK Group, the Daejeon center will continue to help turn ideas into new business and support the global expansion of Korea’s promising venture companies,” said Lim Jong-tae, director of the Daejeon Creative Economy Innovation Center.By Sohn Ji-young ()",SK innovation center boosts start-ups,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150724000919&ACE_SEARCH=1
"This is the seventh and final article in a series on foreigners working in Korea’s technology start-up ecosystem. ― Ed.PinStory, a food recommendation start-up in Seoul, is the poster image of diversity: A Korean ex-banker and a Spanish ex-restaurateur and developer spotted a shortage of restaurant information in English and joined together last year to create a quality-driven directory of Seoul’s best eateries for a foreign audience. Universe Shin, the start-up’s cofounder and CEO, said he finds value in the diverse backgrounds of his staff, which now includes members from the U.S., Spain, Ethiopia, Korea and Japan.“Even if we focus on the Korean market, I think different points of view are very, very important,” he said. “For a tech start-up, before making any decisions, we should be careful to listen to every idea. Different point of views come from diversity, be it race, nationality, sex or age.”The Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province-based start-up’s multicultural staff is an exceptional case in Korea. Shin was able to hire whomever he needed with no fuss from immigration services, but he admits that most start-ups find it difficult to hire foreigners.Foreign entrepreneurs in Korea say their biggest hurdle is not the cultural challenges ― ranging from language barriers to hierarchical business traditions ― but instead those opportunities out of reach due to the legal difficulties of hiring a foreigner or founding a company.“The major obstacle is the visa system. It is so difficult for foreigners to legally work with start-ups that many end up quitting,” said Nick Szabo, chief operating officer of Swizzle, a video-clipping app.Entrepreneurs complain that not only is the visa requirement information hard to find, but too many regulations are subject to interpretation by the immigration office agent, such as whether the applicant has relevant work experience and documentation. Some said they have spent several months procuring documents, only to later find out they were the wrong ones.“Nobody seems to actually understand the system. Everyone I have talked to about getting a visa, either as an entrepreneur or an employee, has said the same thing: ‘Go to the immigration office two times, and you will get two completely different answers to every question you ask,’” Szabo said.The government has made efforts to ease the process by creating a start-up visa for technology entrepreneurs, but some applicants have found themselves facing confused immigration officers who do not understand the new requirements. Moreover, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, two institutes offering a class called OASIS-9 for entrepreneurs to collect points toward the start-up visa and gain up to 50 million won ($43,000) in public funding, have recently cut their budgets from funding 15 teams to eight ― meaning foreign entrepreneurs will have even less access to seed funding ― and now require foreign entrepreneurs to have a Korean partner to qualify for financial support.“(The visa regulation system) is definitely a problem that needs to change if this start-up ecosystem really wants to get off the ground. Seoul could very easily take over as the bridge from East to West if they got a handle on this,” Szabo added.Industry observers speculate that government efforts to increase support for foreigners, both legal and financial, are stymied by a public sense of protectionism that foreign workers will directly compete with local jobs. Some entrepreneurs say to make the ecosystem more global-friendly, foreigners need to be perceived as collaborative and contributing to the local industry.Korea, ranked No. 5 this year in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, has long been a leader especially in Asia in welcoming foreign business through free trade agreements, free economic zones and foreign investment attraction. But to create a healthy ecosystem for small, innovative businesses like technology start-ups, the next step is to integrate the influx of foreigners and foreign companies by improving the infrastructure for visas and Korean education, noted Jason Minkee Kim, creator of story-sharing platform My Memoirs.Likewise, foreigners should learn how to assimilate into the Korean workforce and market their technical abilities where they are needed in Korea’s strong industries like high-tech exports, Kim said.“If foreigners want to integrate in Korea, they must focus on making themselves presentable in these industries,” he added. “If you can create something valuable in Korea as a foreigner, you can change the perception and market, paving the way for future foreigners to create something amazing as well.”Entrepreneurs claim that foreigners can play a specific role in making Korea’s nascent creative economy richer by using their individual backgrounds to bring disparate ideas together.The majority of start-ups in Korea have global aspirations, but the local market is so different from the rest of the world that a global team is vital for doing business abroad, from talking to foreign investors to developing strategies for different markets, said Szabo of Swizzle.CEO David Park of KOISRA Seed Partners, a Korean-Israeli seed fund and accelerator, pointed out the government’s key priority for the creative economy is solving youth unemployment by forming new job opportunities, though the government has not yet reached the point of knowing how to advance its creativity. To get to the next level, he added, Korea must consider the role of diversity in its start-up industry.Park encouraged more programs to have Korean and foreign entrepreneurs working side by side instead of in separate incubation centers, and suggested that any start-up assistance for Koreans should be available to foreigners. “Wherever there is a Korean start-up, there should be a center or person who can help them do business with foreigners,” he said.Beyond giving out funding and office space, the most practical solution for a better working environment is normalizing regulations, entrepreneurs say.The brittle changes in the laws make foreign entrepreneurs, researchers and investors nervous about entering the local ecosystem, which is still restrictive in terms of labor laws and intellectual protection, said David-Pierre Jalicon, chairman of the French-Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry.“When (foreign investors) arrive, they don’t see development. Or sometimes they see the law change in a totally opposite direction,” he said, citing the reform last year of ordinary wages that was proposed to be applied retroactively. “We need more predictability.”The government’s key role in facilitating foreigners doing business here, he stressed, is to provide a stable, predictable intellectual property, legal, tax and business environment that is unambiguous and straightforward.To do that, it should focus on either deregulating or providing a one-stop system to provide comprehensive information on the laws in English, such as through a central call center, annual meeting or clear announcements to inform foreigners of legal reforms, Jalicon said.The Seoul Global Center, a Seoul City-run expat assistance agency, is a helpful source for foreigners, he noted, but there are many issues that cannot be worked out by local governments, he and other industry observers noted. The French chamber is likewise limited. He said that an “umbrella” system that helps entrepreneurs handle visa and other issues all under one roof would assuage foreigners’ fears of doing business here.“Once there is this (umbrella system), and once this is communicated abroad, I’m sure many people will plug in,” Jalicon said.Jeet Dhindsa, creator of medical tourism platform My Seoul Secret and one of the first recipients of Korea’s start-up visa, said Korea’s own stigma against the creative process and focus on the end game are its biggest hurdles to creative growth.“I think that a lot of challenges in their way is Korean culture itself,” Dhindsa said. “If you want a creative economy, you have to have a creative process, and in the creative process, there are no rules. And they might break rules that are going to make the culture feel uncomfortable, so that’s going to be the challenge.”Ultimately, fostering this spirit of creativity to drive an innovative economy requires a change of mindset that values diverse ideas and ways of thinking, which can only be cultivated in the long term through education, industry experts and entrepreneurs said.Jalicon believes cross-cultural connections can be a win-win for Korean and foreign entrepreneurs. Korean companies ― and their investors ― are too focused on short-term, results-driven, practical applications that hinder a truly creative progress, as evidenced by the country’s failure to produce Nobel Prize winners, he said. Meanwhile, countries like France exercise limitless innovation, but may not know how to apply their developments. He points out a need for two-way openness toward change between Korea and the rest of the world, adding that Europe would like to see more Korean investors to help facilitate change as well. In the creative economy, the different mindsets can complement each other by mixing France’s innovation with Korea’s application, Jalicon said. He suggested starting out with small projects under a long-term vision, and praised the tangible efforts coming from both countries. Korea’s KAIST has signed a number of memorandums of understanding with overseas institutions to promote innovation-driven collaboration, including with France’s public investment bank Bpifrance to create Korean-French start-ups, he noted.He stressed that foreigners cannot and should not aim to change Korea, but that citizens must be self-motivated to improve their own creative economy.“It is not overnight and I really believe in the current capacity of changing. When they see the reality, when they fight the issue, they have a capacity to change.”By Elaine Ramirez(elaine@heraldcorp.com)",Foreign start-ups seek legal clarity,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150727001076&ACE_SEARCH=1
"DAEJEON ― The Daejeon Creative Economy Innovation Center, an institute run by SK Group to support start-ups, has become a hotbed of business creativity. Housed at KAIST, one of Korea’s most prestigious tech and science universities, the creative economy center was jointly established by Daejeon Metropolitan City, KAIST, and SK Group last October with an aim to nurture entrepreneurs and help fledgling businesses conduct research and development and commercialize their technology at home and abroad.Through the creative center, five ventures have raised 1.3 billion won ($1.2 million) in funding, and three of them have already posted 694 million won in sales so far. The number of employees hired by the start-ups is also growing steadily.The center is encouraging tech-savvy students and researchers to launch start-up business and two-thirds of the chief executives at a total of the 13 start-ups backed by the center hold master’s or doctoral degrees, according to SK Group. “Since the launch last year, the creative center has been a breath of fresh air in the research and development cluster in Daejeon by helping researchers to start their businesses with their technology and patents,” said Lee Jae-ho, the head of the CEIC.The businesses participating in the entrepreneurship programs of the CEIC include NanoLambda, which develops micro spectrometers, TEGway, the developer of world’s first wearable sensors that generate power utilizing body heat, Web-based video editing program maker MJV and budget action camera producer THES.TEGway’s wearable thermoelectric generator won a Netexplo award this year, which is given by UNESCO to the world’s top 10 innovations that could create a positive impact on human life.“For start-ups, marketing is the biggest sticking point, but the CEIC’s venture programs help the participants to reach out to potential buyers and customers at home and abroad,” Lee Kyung-soo, the head of TEGway, said in a meeting with reporters on Friday at the CEIC.SK Group is also working with the Sejong City government to transform villages where most of residents are seniors into smart towns.Helping farmers efficiently manage and monitor their farms, greenhouses, and barns with ICT devices is in line with such efforts.With smartphones, farmers can monitor and control temperatures inside greenhouses where they grow produce like strawberries and tomatoes.“The installation of the farm management systems makes it more convenient to monitor produce as farmers do not need to stay inside the greenhouse all night to maintain the right temperature,” said Jang Geol-soon, a farmer in the model smart farm town Yeondong-myeon, Sejong City.Smart surveillance cameras installed across the town also serve as guardians to protect the town from thieves looking to steal agricultural produce or farm animals.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)","SK Group, local governments team up to back start-ups",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150201000081&ACE_SEARCH=1
"SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won cheered on staffers by visiting the group’s provincial-based innovation centers Tuesday, in line with his stated promise to lend a hand in reviving the South Korean economy and support the government’s ongoing drive for a creative economy.Chey made his way down to the two SK innovation centers in Daejeon and Sejong, located south of Seoul, in a bid to “express the group’s will to contribute to the country’s economic growth through the success of its creative economy innovation centers,” said group spokesman Lee Man-woo.He also visited the Chungbuk Creative Economy Innovation Center, a biopharmaceuticals start-up incubator led by LG Group, seeking to find ways for the nation’s 17 innovation centers to synergize and benchmark each other’s success.His visits came amid rising pressure on SK to take the lead in revitalizing the economy, following Chey’s release from prison last week through special presidential pardons granted to high-profile businessmen to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan.The SK chief -- who has swiftly returned to management after spending more than two years in jail on embezzlement charges -- had vowed to step up efforts to reinvigorate the stagnant economy upon his release.At the Daejeon center, the chairman called for “speedier and expanded measures to bolster new growth in the field of creative economy” and pledged to “turn the center into a major support hub for the creation of new business in the science and technology sector,” according to SK Group.Located at KAIST, one of Korea’s most prestigious universities focusing on science and technology research and development, the center opened its doors in October 2014 aiming to nurture information and communications technology-based start-ups.He met and encouraged the heads of the venture firms that had taken part in the center’s inaugural start-up incubating program, which offered one-on-one business mentorship and marketing support led by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning alongside SK Group.“Let us work together to create a creative economy business atmosphere by building a win-win business ecosystem with SK Group,” Chey said, adding that “creating a viable environment for start-ups takes efforts by both (conglomerates and venture firms) toward a common goal.”Chey also presented himself at the group’s Sejong Creative Economy Innovation Center, launched in June to nurture new start-ups in the agriculture sector with a particular focus on using information and communication technology to improve local farming systems.“The fusion of agriculture and high technology to bring about revolutionary changes truly shows the creative economy at work in this sector,” Chey told officials at the Sejong center, adding that “such a business model should be expanded across Korea and the world.”Moreover, the SK chairman asked group officials to devise new ways to use the two centers to boost the success of the group’s recently announced job creation plans to hire some 24,000 new employees over the next two years.In line with his orders, SK Group said it will work to “further develop and utilize the group’s leading technology in the energy, chemicals and semiconductors sectors to drive forward the growth of Korean venture firms.”The country’s third-largest conglomerate is also mulling an envisioned plan to invest roughly 46 trillion won ($38 billion) into the group’s chip making unit SK hynix, following a high-level meeting attended by Chey and the heads of the group’s key affiliates Monday.Aiming to hire more young employees and boost job security, SK is considering the implementation of the wage peak system across all its affiliates by next year as well.Under this system pushed by the government and being adopted by other conglomerates like Samsung, LG and Lotte, the retirement age has been extended while the paycheck for elderly workers reduced over their last several years at work.By Sohn Ji-young ()",[Newsmaker] SK chairman catches up on creative economy boost,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150818000910&ACE_SEARCH=1

"LAS VEGAS ― Starting a business is not an easy job. Even if you have a great idea, you may not know where and with whom to start. U.S.-based crowdfunding firm Kickstarter says it provides an ideal platform which anyone can use to launch a start-up and achieve innovation through sharing their ideas with others.“Kickstarter is a much more democratic system,” Kickstarter representative David Gallagher told The Korea Herald at the International CES, held from Jan. 6-9 in Las Vegas. “If you want to make a device, you don’t have to convince Samsung to buy your idea. You can take your idea straight to people and ask them if they want to fund your idea (on Kickstarter),” he added.On the crowdfunding website, people can launch a fund-raising project in almost any industry sector including film, music and information technology, and ask others for technical or financial support to get the ball rolling. In return, supporters are given rewards in any form, including final products.First launched in 2009, so far around 8 million people have pledged over $1 billion, funding some 80,000 projects, according to Kickstarter. All it takes to begin a start-up that could become the next Facebook or Google is to “have determination and find good collaborators,” according to John Dimatos, Kickstarter’s project specialist for design and technology.“If we can help people find those who want the same thing that you want, that is the goal of Kickstarter.”In contrast to the conservative and exclusive business environment of the past, members of the global start-up community, especially those partnering with Kickstarter, are more open-minded and respectful of others’ ideas, according to Dimatos.“In contrast to the mentality of like, ‘I have this idea and I am going to keep it secret,’ now we think about a much more open approach to technology where people are like, ‘I have this idea and what do you think about it?’” he said.Giving kudos to some Korean tech-savvy institutions such as KAIST, one of the most prominent tech universities in Korea, the two Kickstarter officials emphasized the importance of technological convergence with other fields.“An artist who wants to be an engineer and an engineer who wants to be more like an artist. Those teams combining the two together are the ones that are going to do really well,” Dimatos said.

"[] Speculations are high that  may discard the Note brand, as the company’s brand reputation has suffered serious damage from the Galaxy Note 7 explosions and the consequent pullout.“Samsung is recommended to drop the Note brand as consumers may still find it dangerous even when the new Note 8 comes out,” Kim Duk-jin, the vice chief of private-run Korea-Insight Institute, told The Korea Herald. The tech giant Monday halted production of its flagship phablets upon repeated incidents of it catching fire in different parts of the world. On Tuesday, it officially decided to discontinue the smartphone.According to the institute, the perception of the Galaxy Note 7 has significantly changed over the past two months, even in Samsung’s home turf Korea. Negative perception of the phone rose to 53 percent in October from 34 percent in August when the phone was first rolled out. Positive perception has dropped to 42 percent from 62 percent during the same period, according to the institute, citing local solutions firm Konan Technology which analyzes social network services. Its brand reputation has also been hit hard globally as many airports issued notices banning passengers from carrying the Galaxy Note 7 onboard or in cargo, following dozens of reports of the fire-prone smartphones. However, Samsung is likely to retain the Galaxy brand because the cost would be too high to rebuild another premium brand like Galaxy, which still has a high profile and loyalty globally, according to experts. Lee Hae-hoon, a lawmaker of The Saenuri Party, said the halt in production of the Note 7 costs Samsung around 2.2 trillion won ($1.9 billion), adding, “Samsung appears to have given up the money to save the reputation of the Galaxy brand.” The Galaxy series was first unveiled in 2010 after the production of Omnia -- which was known for bugs and low performance -- was discontinued. At this point, the most critical move for Samsung is to find out the causes of the Note 7 explosions and restore trust in the market, experts said. “Samsung should first accurately find out what led to the explosions and honestly disclose them to consumers. If the design was the problem, thorough investigation should be carried out before launching the Galaxy S8,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST’s College of Business. Samsung’s new flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 is expected to be unveiled with drastic changes at the Mobile World Congress in February next year. The new phone is likely to adopt a bezel-less screen without a home button. But this significant physical change may also lead to technical faults, as a bezel-less screen is more vulnerable to external shock and consumes more battery, which may also cause heating problems, experts said. “As the hasty launch of the Galaxy Note 7 has been said to have contributed to the crisis this time, Samsung should not feel rushed to unveil new features for Galaxy S8,” an industry source said.

"Lee Joo-hyun, 33, does not want to replace her Galaxy Note 7 with another smartphone although she is afraid of possible explosions. She said she does not want to give up the functions she has been enjoying with her Note 7.“I am satisfied with the upgraded S Pen stylus. I cannot find the same function even from other smartphones made by Samsung,” Lee said, who has only used smartphones under the Galaxy series for several years.The Galaxy fan said she wished she could continue using the smartphone, while admitting she would end up getting it exchanged as the withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 means it would be difficult to get it repaired or have its software upgraded. Another user surnamed Hur, 41, also wants to keep using his Note 7 despite some battery problems. “My Note 7 went through an inspection during the first recall and they said it was okay,” Hur said, adding, “I am satisfied with my phone except for the battery issue.”In September, Samsung Electronics upgraded software for the original devices so that their batteries would charge only up to 60 percent to prevent explosions.  Experts said the continued loyalty among some users is because smartphone consumers find it hard to change platforms once they are used to a smartphone’s interface and functions. “It is not easy for users to shift to a new platform because they have to readjust to functions such as payment, apps and content,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST’s College of Business.“That is why smartphone makers are focused on developing content to increase loyalty from their consumers,” Lee added.The latest survey by tech media Sammobile showed that 91.7 percent of 5,715 Galaxy users said they are still willing to buy Galaxy Note series despite the explosion issues. Meanwhile, American financial company Standard & Poor’s said Thursday its ratings on Samsung Electronics are not affected by the company’s recent decision to halt production of the Galaxy Note 7. “We believe the impact on the ratings will be limited at this stage mainly because of Samsung Electronics’ significant net cash holdings of about 65 trillion won ($58.3 billion) and strong operating cash flow,” S&P said in a statement.By Shin Ji-hye ()",Some consumers remain loyal to Note 7 despite explosions,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20161013000965&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Foreign companies operating in South Korea generally shared views that the presidential scandal does not directly affect their business -- yet. However, if the political issue is prolonged, it may pose stronger risks as it could slow the country’s economic activity, the executives said. Korea is currently reeling from a political scandal involving Choi Soon-sil, who is accused of peddling influence and interfering in state affairs as a secret adviser to President Park Geun-hye.  Amid growing protest in Seoul demanding the president step down, foreign companies here viewed the issue as a strictly political scandal with a wait-and-see attitude. “I found the whole story very absurd. It seems very contradictory to this tech-savvy and advanced nation,” said an executive working for a German tech company. He added that it took him a long time to understand what “the eight fairies” often cited alongside scandal coverage meant.The “eight fairies” refer to an alleged group of unofficial advisers who have enjoyed extensive access to the president.“Still, it does not affect our business or future investment plan in the short run because the political scandal does not appear to affect our business directly for the time being. We will watch how the government will handle the issue,” he added. Another official at a Korean unit of a California-based major IT firm said, “Currently, no talks are ongoing at the headquarters level, as they do not take this issue seriously. It seems there is a gap between how they view it and what we feel here.”Experts said this is because the issue has stoked outrage among ordinary Korean citizens, which foreigners feel is less relevant to them.“Foreign companies and investment banks still appear to view the issue as a mere presidential scandal because they see the issue more objectively than emotionally,” said Kim Sung-tae, a researcher at the state-run think tank Korea Development Institute. “However, things may change if all the facts (involving Choi) are disclosed and a government reshuffle is carried out,” Kim added. Also, the way the government and political circles handle the scandal will be crucial, the observers said, citing how a prolonged scandal may hurt national credibility and slow economic activity. ”We have so far considered the issue as mere political gossip. But, if the gap in state affairs is prolonged and this leads to an economic slowdown, it would have a negative impact on the global companies doing business here,” said an executive working for foreign auto company. Lee Min-wha, a professor at KAIST, said, “What companies dislike the most is uncertainty. If this political uncertainty lasts for long, companies -- whether local or foreign -- will find it hard to make decisions and this will have negative impacts on their business.”By Shin Ji-hye ()",Foreign firms unfazed by presidential scandal,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20161101000824&ACE_SEARCH=1

"Sanofi-Aventis Korea, the local affiliate of France-based global health care company Sanofi, said Thursday it has sealed a partnership with two leading Korean universities to jointly research and develop a new range of immune cell therapies.Sanofi is joining hands with Korea’s leading science research universities KAIST and Seoul National University to develop an “immune cell therapy platform” to produce high-performance immune cell therapies to treat cancer.The global pharma giant is looking to combine the effects of a new antibody developed by a team of researchers at SNU’s College of Medicine with a new peptide developed by KAIST, using upgraded stem cell technology developed by another team at SNU.The team’s goal is to “develop an upgraded immune cell platform that minimizes damage to normal cells during immune cell therapy” by improving the immune system’s ability to tell normal cells apart from those that seem “foreign,” said SNU Professor Chung Jun-ho, whose team developed the new antibody.“Upon commercialization, the platform will greatly reduce the amount of side effects in treating common cancers like liver cancer and enable maximized treatment effects,” Chung said.“We plan to develop the first immune cell platform to treat cancer in the Asia-Pacific region,” said KAIST’s Chun Sang-yong. “We hope to create successful synergy between Korea’s academic circles and a global pharmaceutical company.”The recent cooperative partnership comes as Sanofi continues its efforts to promote “open innovation,” a paradigm encouraging firms to partner with outside actors to share knowledge to accelerate internal innovation.“Sanofi has been making diverse efforts for the advancement of the Korean pharmaceutical sector by striking strategic R&D partnerships, working to discover and develop new drug technologies through open innovation,” said Kim Sang-kyun from Sanofi’s research and development division.“This three-way partnership will set the foundation for Sanofi to embark onto the local and global immune cell therapy segment in the future,” he said.Sanofi-Aventis Korea, which was named an “innovative pharmaceutical company” by the Health Ministry in 2014, is currently engaged in an ongoing partnership with a number of biotechnology companies and research institutions including the Asan Medical Center and local biotech venture ANRT.By Sohn Ji-young ()",Sanofi teams up with top Korean universities for new drug R&D,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160107001090&ACE_SEARCH=1

"Anticipation is growing as the showdown between top Korean Go player Lee Se-dol and artificial intelligence software AlphaGo will take place in Seoul early next month. The Go match, consisting of five games scheduled between March 9 and 15, has been garnering attention from the public, enthusiasts of the game and the technology sector.Jung Jae-seung, a bio and brain engineering professor of KAIST, said, “The match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo is more than just a challenge posed by an AI program fitted with advanced Go skills that can go against a human.“It means that just like humans, an AI program can now learn from experience and map out strategies with reasoning.”At a press meeting held Monday in Seoul, the Korean Go player, known for his forthrightness and boldness, appeared confident about the upcoming face-off against the computer program.“Regardless of the result, the match will be a historic one in Go history,” he said.Though he acknowledged that AI has greatly advanced, he predicts that the machine will “hardly be able to win one of the five games -- at least not this time.”",[Graphic News] AI takes on human in Go,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160223001102&ACE_SEARCH=1
"In the lead up to the historic match between the world’s top Go player Lee Se-dol and Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence computer AlphaGo, there are mixed views among experts about who will emerge victorious. Experts in the Go field -- including Lee Se-dol himself – said that the human will be the winner of the five-game match, which kicks off on March 9. The professional Go player predicted a 5-0 or 4-1 victory in his favor during a press briefing on Feb. 22. Showing confidence in winning, Lee said, “Because the company has had only five months to improve the system since its game against Fan Hui, I don’t think it will be a very close match.” The French two dan player Fan Hui lost to AlphaGo 5-0 in October. Other professional Go players shared similar views. Lee Chang-ho, one of the strongest modern Go players in the world, also predicted, “It will be an interesting match, but I think Lee Se-dol will win this time.”However, experts in the AI field, including Google’s DeepMind, rated AlphaGo’s competence a little higher. “AlphaGo must have thrown down the gauntlet to the world’s top player after completing its preparations to win,” said Kim Jin-ho, a professor, who lectures on big data at the Seoul School of Integrated Sciences & Technologies.“The computer takes only a few weeks to learn from one million matches while a human needs more than 1,000 years,” he said, predicting “AlphaGo will win a complete victory in the five-game match.”DeepMind’s founder Demis Hassabis also predicted that AlphaGo has a fifty-fifty chance of winning, saying, “AlphaGo’s goal is to beat the best human players not just mimic them.”Although there are different views toward the outcome of the historic game that will take place between man and machine, one thing seems clear – the machine will ultimately be the winner. Most professional Go players, including Lee himself, have predicted that Lee will win this time, but they remain uncertain about future wins. Lee had said, “I may win this time but I am not sure what will happen in one to two years.” To AlphaGo, winning or losing in the upcoming match is not important, said DeepMind’s Hassabis. What DeepMind wants from the match is to gain data from the world’s top player and to eventually become the top in Go. “The development speed of AI, which learns without rest or sleep, has been faster than the expectations of scholars. After all, time is on AlphaGo’s side,” said Lee Sung-hwan, a professor from the department of brain and cognitive engineering at Korea University. “Even if AlphaGo loses at the match, it is almost 100 percent sure that the computer will win by the end of this year because it can learn even without Go records,” said Kim Jin-hyung, a professor of KAIST and head of the Software Policy & Research Institute. Despite such claims, there are some experts who still wish to bet on humans. “It is true that computers have already outdone humans’ memories and calculations. But, they still don’t have something humans are good at,” said Lee Kwang-hyung, a dean of KAIST Moon Soul Graduate School of Future Strategy. “Creativity -- it is still men’s domain.”By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)",[Weekender] Mixed outlook for human-versus-AI match,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160304000730&ACE_SEARCH=1

"Amid struggles in the Chinese market, where users are increasingly attracted by local alternatives, Samsung Electronics underlined that China is and will continue to be the most important market for its smartphone business.“We will continue to make efforts to gain trust and love from Chinese consumers with Samsung’s technology and products,” said Samsung’s mobile head Koh Dong-Jin at the launch event for the Galaxy Note 8 in Beijing on Wednesday. His announcement came amid the Korean tech firm’s weak sales in the nation.  Samsung’s market share in China has dropped to as low as 3 percent this year after grabbing the top spot with around 14 percent in 2014, according to the US research firm Strategy Analytics. “Samsung’s glory days in China are almost over due to rising Chinese handset makers with quality products and consumers’ brand loyalty,” said Kim Jong-ki, a researcher specializing in the mobile industry at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.Eight Chinese phone makers, including Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, now hold a more than 70 percent market share in the nation. In June and July, Huawei beat Apple to become the world’s largest smartphone maker by sales, according to the US market research firm Counterpoint Research. Amid weak sales, Samsung has cut around 20,000 jobs in China over the past two years and replaced the head of its Chinese unit in spring. Still, China is too big for Samsung to give up, industry watchers said. Although Samsung may not be able to recapture its glory in the nation’s budget smartphone market, its premium market is too attractive to give up. “China’s rich class -- although it makes up a small portion -- still constitutes a large number. Samsung pins its hope on the higher value-added market,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor of KAIST College of Business. China’s rich -- estimated to make up around 5 percent of the total population -- still represents 650 million people, more than 10 times the population of Korea. “In order to stand out from the competition with Apple in the premium market, Samsung should provide better pricing policies (discount and subsidy) and customized services,” Lee said. For the Note 8 release in China, Samsung has partnered with Chinese mobile payment services, WeChat Pay and AliPay. It also worked with China’s bike-sharing company, Mobike, allowing the Note 8 users to use the bikes simply by scanning a QR code. The price of the Galaxy Note 8 starts at 6,988 yuan ($1,066) for the 64-gigabyte model, while the price of Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 is estimated to start at 5,888 yuan and the iPhone X at 8,388 yuan.

"“Made in Forest” organic cosmetics brand Rootree is planning to promote its overseas expansion to the Vietnamese market, following the recent advancement to the market in Russia.Rootree is expected to host a brand launching event and press conference in Hannoi, Vietnam, next month. The announcement makes clear the brand’s intentions of advancing to the Asian market. Rootree signed a $420,000 contract with Goshen Korea, one of Russia’s cosmetics distributor company, as well as finalized its entrance to L’etoile, making a debut in Russian market.  L’etoile is known to be the beauty shop with Russia’s No. 1, and world’s No. 3 sales volume. The shop has various premium brands in its business such as Chanel, Lancome, Estee Lauder and more. An official of L’etoile emphasized that they confirmed the future sales potential of Rootree in Russia, after six months of detailed local market analysis. As a note, Russia’s cosmetics import scale is eighth worldwide and is expected to grow annually. The reason behind Rootree being able to gain popularity from overseas market was due to three functions they incorporated to their cosmetics product: functions acquired from naturally grown tree in Jeju Island’s forest. To be more specific, the first is the antioxidant function of Korean dendropanax, second is the hydration function of Japanese cedar, and last is the circulation function of camphor tree. With these natural functions, Rootree is capable of soothing the skin. Dermatology experts recommended skin management via natural organic cosmetics product as it irritates the skin less. Rootree’s products perfectly match this theory. Recently, Rootree presented their fresh slogan “Made in Forest” to emphasize its concept of having pure Jeju Island forest’s vitality. The slogan denotes its brand philosophy of staying put as natural organic cosmetics for modern people’s exhausted facial skin due to extended exposure in ultraviolet radiation and fine dust.“Our expansion to Russian market was very successful through close market analysis. We have on-going numerous requests coming in from Vietnam currently. Based on this opportunity, we will strengthen our position as the global natural organic cosmetic brand,” said Kim Ji-Hwan, the chief of Rootree Cosmetics. Meanwhile, Rootree was first co-established by KT CS and KAIST’s leading venture business “Color Pink R&D” in November, 2014. The company‘s cosmetics are composed of 19 items from 5 lines which are: Camphorganic, Mobittherapy, Treetherapy, Cryptherapy and Golden Tree Edition. Rootree’s Camphorganic product line, in particular, is assessed to be outstanding after inclusion of 86 percent organic substances in the product, which is far exceeding Europe’s ECOCERT certification of 10 percent. The product is optimal in taking care of face skin since it contains nature-originated elements and organic raw materials. Moreover, the product does not use filtered water but rather a 100 percent organic chamomile extracted water, providing far better hydration effects to the customers. The steady bestseller product “Camphorganic Returning Essence” is gaining popularity, as the season switches to fall. This is because the product is adequate for use in dry weather. The essence attains 94 percent organic raw materials and 99 percent natural raw materials, leading to smoothness of skin texture and skin pores and brightening of skin.“’Rootree Camphorganic Essence‘s biggest advantage is its use of 100 percent organic extracted water rather than normal filtered water. It did not add any chemical elements known to irritate skin, such as Paraben and artificial dyes. People of all skin types are able to use the essence, and its hydration effect is always perfect,” said an official from Rootree. ()",Organic cosmetics Rootree expands beyond domestic market,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170928000303&ACE_SEARCH=1

"South Korea’s science and technology university KAIST has partnered with the World Economic Forum to help Korea and the global community prepare for the major changes and challenges expected to come from the “fourth industrial revolution.”KAIST and WEF signed a memorandum of understanding in Seoul on Friday, agreeing to cooperate in researching issues such as anticipated major labor market shifts as industries adopt next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence.It is the first formalized partnership that the WEF has sealed with an academic institution, according to the Switzerland-based international organization.  The fourth industrial revolution is a term coined by the WEF’s Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab at the Davos summit in 2016, referring to a new, connected digital economy buttressed by technological breakthroughs in fields like AI, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, robotics, big data computing and nanotechnology.The WEF has since been taking the lead in devising governance models and strategies for better job creation and setting up a regulatory framework that can support the safe adoption of new tech innovations across countries.Joining WEF’s efforts, KAIST will help WEF in compiling a Korea-specific version of the “Future of Jobs Report.” It will become the first country-specific version of WEF’s global job future forecast report, according to the international organization.“To move forward the new age of the fourth industrial revolution, every country needs to devise the appropriate policies that are tailored to their specific markets. KAIST is looking to contribute to this process for Korea as well as the broader international community,” said KAIST President Shin Sung-chul. In addition, the Daejeon-based university will send its research fellows to WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco, contributing to research and policymaking for new technologies like blockchain, IoT, AI, autonomous vehicles and precision medicine.It will also leverage its technological leadership in areas like drones, big data, autonomous vehicles, and humanoid robots to support WEF’s initiatives in these areas, it said.The KAIST-WEF memorandum was signed on the sidelines of a roundtable co-hosted by the two entities in Seoul on Friday. The event was organized with a focus on shaping Korea’s priorities for inclusive growth and job creation in the fourth industrial revolution.Leaders from the government, businesses, universities and nonprofit civic organizations took part in the discussions, including the head of the WEF Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Murat Sonmez and KAIST President Shin Sung-chul, Doosan Group Vice Chairman Lee Hyun-soon as well as Korea Venture Business Association President Ahn Keon-Joon.Topics explored during the one-day event included “Inclusive growth and the Fourth Industrial Revolution” as well as “Future Jobs,” “Creation of Innovation Ecosystems” and “SME 4.0 Initiative.” By Sohn Ji-young ()",KAIST partners with WEF for ‘4th industrial revolution’ push,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171013000685&ACE_SEARCH=1
"The question of balance between applied and basic science continues to be debated in most countries, including Korea. Since there seems to be so much need for public support of impoverished people, how can we spend valuable resources to fund curiosity driven research?Basic science can provide revolutionary technologies and ideas; helps keep the local industry up-to-date with the latest developments; encourages constant competition via technology transfer programs; and most importantly, trains the next generation of scientists and engineers in Korea to tackle problems in fundamentally new ways. A well-balanced approach to applied and basic science is best, as the elimination of basic science would be very dangerous to the vitality of the scientific community of Korea.I am the director of the IBS Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research, or IBS/CAPP in short. Our main goal is to probe a certain dark matter candidate called axion that may be filing all of the space between the stars in our galaxy, therefore providing the glue needed to keep them from flying away into outer space. Our plan is to apply very powerful, large volume magnets and see hints of this glue by generating power seemingly out of nothing at one frequency in the microwave spectrum. As the generated power is small, we need to immerse the antennas and keep the critical part of the electronics system very near absolute zero temperature and shield it all from any possible environmental noise.Even if we discover the axions to be part of the dark matter, the expected benefits from this discovery in the foreseeable future have to do with fundamental questions about the universe, the Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research and galaxy dynamics. Yes, Korea may even land a Nobel Prize but what do the Korean people get in return for all this investment? A highly esteemed colleague of mine and director of another IBS center jokingly accused me of being the director of the most “useless” IBS center. He meant that even if we are successful, the final product is of no immediate use. However, this is a complete misunderstanding of our work. The goals of IBS/CAPP are extremely difficult to achieve. If our plan succeeds we should be able to finally determine whether or not axions are indeed part of the dark matter, a question scientists around the world have been struggling with for almost 40 years.To do this herculean task we need to develop systems that currently don’t exist and are very hard to achieve. We identified and targeted them and are putting tremendous effort into bringing them to fruition because we are interested in answering nature’s fundamental questions.In the process, we collaborate with the best international institutions and some of the smartest people on earth, learning from and with them. At the highest level, many times scientists work together as a team and share their expertise. As a result of our learning, we expect in the next two- to five-year period to transfer technology to Korean companies that will be worth several hundred million dollars, all benefitting Korea. The benefit level will be far above any conceivable investment we will receive as an IBS center.However, the most valuable outcome of basic science is the training of current and future scientists to learn to work together in a highly competitive and high-pressure environment. Not all trained scientists stay in basic science -- actually only a very small percentage do. Most of them go on to become civil servants or engineers, teachers, etc., working to solve complex problems of immediate use or training other students. It is well known that a group of highly motivated people is much more effective in solving complex problems than the sum of the work of individuals. During group meetings, scientists need to feel free to express an opposing opinion in the strongest possible ways without the dangers of either fighting among themselves or insulting an important figure. Some of our teams in our center have achieved innovation levels the likes of which can only be seen in the best institutions around the world. Not unrelated, they have also developed the ability to debate at the highest levels, helping to ensure our leadership position in the field.In a very short time we have established a strong international presence in our field and our methods will ensure that we will always be highly competitive. We are preparing to lead in the field for the foreseeable future, after completing the infrastructure of our world-class center, answering some of the most fundamental questions in nature today, giving back to the Korean people and making them proud. When done right, basic science can be a strong pillar supporting applied science and helping to drive the next innovation revolution in Korea.Yannis K.

"DAEJEON -- In 2000, professor Yoo Hoi-jun of the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology predicted that cellphone screens would grow larger and users would play games on the phones. To prove his prophesy, he confidently showcased demos of mobile chips to tech titans like Samsung, Nvidia and Sony at the time, though to lukewarm responses. In 2006, Yoo came up with even more advanced argument: artificial intelligence would be the future. The expert on electrical and electronics engineering was inspired by the book “Astonishing Hypothesis” by Nobel laureate Francis Crick, who co-discovered the molecular structure of DNA. Yoo was reading the book at a cafe in San Diego after presenting a paper on a neural network system that fastens and improves processing graphic data on mobile devices at an academic conference in the Silicon Valley. “Inspired by the book, I began developing brain-like neural network chips, believing that the structure of mobile chips would resemble human brain as AI becomes a new norm,” said Yoo in an interview with The Korea Herald. Since then, the professor’s team at KAIST has concentrated their efforts on AI chipsets for mobile devices, and it has won global attention as the team introduced an integrated deep neural network system -- the deep neural processor unit, or DNPU -- at the Hot Chips 2017 conference in August. In the chip structure, the convolutional neural network is used to support vision recognition and processing, while the recurrent neural network is able to recognize time varying entities and support generative models. By combining both CNN and RNN, a system can recognize time-varying visual entities, such as action and gesture, and support image captioning, according to Yoo’s paper. “We focus on reducing power consumption and processing graphic data at real time, when a chip runs in mobile devices, drones and automobiles,” the professor said. “Since the beginning, we have bet on mobile embedded chips.” Google’s AlphaGo that ignited the current AI boom across the globe has adopted Nvidia’s graphic processor unit, which has turned out to be a huge power guzzler. “In the coming February, we plan to showcase demos of more power-efficient and simpler chips that can recognize human gestures,” he said. With those embedded chips, the professor forecasts a future with “friendlier” smartphones. “I don’t think current devices are intelligent enough,” Yoo said. “Until now, devices themselves haven’t changed much, while data has been piling up and memory has been running out. “I expect smartphones to become more customized to users with on-device deep neural networks that support operations of applications just like a human brain does.” Contrary to a government-level initiative to raise software power, Yoo stresses that Korea still needs to invest more in hardware-like chipsets in order to retain the world’s No. 1 position. “Samsung Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun’s message that Samsung needs some breakthroughs should be read seriously,” the professor said. “Korea became a chipset powerhouse thanks to government policies, conglomerates’ swift decision-making and elite workforces (about three decades ago).“There are (now) no government-led research projects on semiconductors, and we are lacking resources to raise young experts,” he said. “The government is sending a message to young students that software is the future and that we are done with the chips.”According to the professor, the number of students studying semiconductors has reduced by a third compared to in the early 1980s, while outstanding talents now tend to shun the field. “Samsung’s Kwon also has been mentioning the need to address the workforce shortage, which can’t be resolved at a company level,” he added.The future of the semiconductors industry can take shape through AI, biomedicine and quantum computing, Yoo said. “Finding new materials and principles for making chips can provide room for innovation in the industry,” he said. “Making quantum devices and organic devices for computing is also being suggested by experts around the world.” “Development of high-performance system on chips for AI and biomedicine is also part of the future,” he added. Processor in memory, or PIM, can be a new lucrative market in the AI era, Yoo suggested. “PIM is a product type that integrates memory chips with a central processor unit, which is mostly sold by Intel,” he said. “Samsung once had attempted to sell similar memory-embedded processor in the late ’90s, but the market was too small at the time.“But PIM can be popular in the near future, as demand for processors with high memory capacity continues to rise to run AI applications.” By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)",[Herald Interview] ‘Semiconductors still have so much room to grow’,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171027000488&ACE_SEARCH=1
"As programs spotlighting alcohol abound on Korean television, concerned viewers are questioning whether there are too many portrayals of uninhibited drinking on the small screen.On Aug. 26, K-pop girl group Mamamoo’s Wheein alarmed viewers by drinking during an online live-streaming and cursing in English. The next day, “I Live Alone” showed singer Tony An’s friends revealing his drinking habits. An had been discovered numerous times sprawled next to the door to his home or on his bedroom floor covered in mysterious red liquid, they testified. In the KBS travel reality show “Battle Trip,” singer Sung Si-kyung, renowned for his copious drinking, talked about chugging dozens of boilermakers, a Korean staple cocktail of beer mixed with hard liquor such as whisky or soju. On travel reality show “2 Days and 1 Night,” actor Cha Tae-hyeon confessed having woken up to find himself stuffed in a trash can after a booze-filled night on several occasions.  According to the Korea Health Promotion Institute, depictions of drinking on television rose 14. 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2014. Alcohol acts as the central theme in several shows currently on air.“Life Bar,” a talk show that started last December on tvN, features celebrities gabbing over booze-related anecdotes and life lessons while consuming drinks of the guest’s choice. There is a five-drinks maximum rule. “There doesn’t have to be a reason when it comes to having a drink,” the show’s introduction says. “When you’re at home enjoying a drink alone and watching (the show), you feel as if you were drinking together with the cast.” “Yolo Life,” which kicked off in July on SkyTV, features celebrities traveling, drinking and embracing the “you-only-live-once” credo. “Even people who previously disliked drinking will become fond of drinking when they watch our show,” producer Seo Soo-min said. “I felt, for men, friends would be people with whom you share that first drink.”  There is no hard-and-fast rule when it comes to drinking scenes on television, according to the Korea Communications Standards Commission. Its regulations stipulate that “alcohol consumption, smoking, speculative acts and extravagant spending” need to be expressed with prudence so as not to “romanticize or encourage” said acts. A nine-member consultative body rules on the appropriateness of each show based on these guidelines. Public consensus is an important factor in the body’s decisions. Because there is a widespread perception that alcohol is a necessary for relieving stress and socializing, its consumption or humorous portrayal of drunkenness is rarely judged “inappropriate” for air, an official at the commission said. On Sept. 1, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Health Promotion Institute launched a body consisting of television writers, producers, viewers, academics and standards enforcers to discuss the impact of alcohol-related television programming.“It’s necessary to talk about the negative effects of inappropriate depictions of drinking in the media,” said Kim Young-wook, professor at the KAIST Moon Soul Graduate School of Future Strategy. “It will lead to a slow but gradual improvement.” By Rumy Doo (doo@heraldcorp.com) ",Alcohol flowing freely on Korean TV,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170905000710&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Hyundai Motor has signed a memorandum of understanding with Technion, an Israeli institute of technology, to jointly develop artificial intelligence and technologies for autonomous driving, the company said Thursday.The joint project also includes a plan to support budding enterprises in Israel and use their ideas to devise new market platform aimed at realizing innovative mobility. South Korea’s Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology also joins the project, the company said. Hyundai Motor‘s cooperation with the Israeli technology institute comes from the carmaker’s recognition of the Middle East nation’s strength in nurturing innovative startups.Mobileye, which develops vision-based driver assistance systems and supplies the systems to most carmakers around the world, is also an Israeli tech company. The company was acquired by US chipmaker Intel for $15.3 billion in March. Hyundai Motor heir Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun has paid a keen interest in Israeli startups, according to the carmaker. He visited Mobileye in May to seek business opportunities with the firm, according to Hyundai. The partnership with Technion is also part of Chung’s idea to seek technological development through startups there. Established by a group of scientists that included Albert Einstein in 1912, Technion has taken a leading role in Israel’s drive to nurturing creative ideas and supporting budding entrepreneurship. More than 60 percent of Technion graduates work for startup companies and more than 50 percent of CEOs in Israeli companies are alumni of the college, the company said in a statement.“Israel is not a country that makes cars, but has been gaining interest for the country’s startups that supply core parts and solution for self-driving cars and connected car (services),” an official said. “Through the tripartite consortium, we expect to secure not only future technologies to lead the ‘fourth industrial innovation,’ but also new engines for the company’s growth.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","Hyundai signs on with Israeli tech institute on self-driving, AI",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170906000743&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Artificial intelligence may be able to sift through the vast pool of online information and discern which news are fake and which are true -- or closer to the truth.A research presentation on the topic was made Thursday at KAIST, a public research university in Daejeon.Cha Mi-young, a professor at the KAIST School of Computing, proposed a future where artificial intelligence trained through deep learning can tell fake news apart from real.KAIST hosts a monthly forum titled “Dinner and 4.0,” where future technology that will lead the “fourth industrial revolution” is discussed. KAIST professors take the opportunity to present their research to public officials and researchers, as well as students. The forum in November was the seventh such event.Fake news became a prominent issue following the discovery that the top 20 percent of political news consumed on Facebook during the recent US presidential race had lacked factual grounds.A significant number of people had presumed the content of articles to be true by looking at accompanying images, headlines and leads, without reading the actual content.The online neologism “tldr,” short for too-long-didn’t-read, reflected the flaw in news systems. Cha attributed the problem to the current online news algorithm that registers the most-clicked news as worthy content to share. The media’s obsession with attracting bigger online traffic worsened the spread of falsified stories.According to Cha’s research, AI that went through deep learning was able to detect over 80 percent of fake news, while the accuracy of human discernment remained at 66 percent.  Cha said there is a pattern in the fake news that AI can pick up. Real news tend to draw attention, or traffic, only at the beginning of an article’s publishing, while fake news prompt continued clicks in sporadic locations by unconnected people. The detected fake information often dodged responsibility as a credible source by using accompanying phrases such as “I’ve heard,” “Not sure, but” and “Someone said.” “There was a time when Koreans took at face value that ‘sleeping with a fan would lead to death.’ It was fake news, but this was translated and spread even to Mexico,” Cha said, highlighting the extent to which fake news can travel.Cha also acknowledged that there are times when people crave real news and when they want to be entertained by light reading. She added, “Effort should still be made for fast detection of fake news and there should be barriers on the dissemination of false information.”Cha also suggested a future in which news is categorized according to its credibility, with the most trustworthy information being labeled as first degree and the least as fifth. This could be achieved by first labeling clean information in order to differentiate what is fake and what is true. Cha expressed a wish to form a team with a startup big data group to lay the groundwork for fact-checking.

"Samsung Electronics’ share of the Chinese smartphone market will drop to below 2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics.According to the report released last week by the US research firm, Samsung ranked ninth in the world’s largest smartphone market, with a 2 percent share in the third quarter. This share is predicted to further drop to 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, according to SA. Samsung, once the dominant player in China with a share of around 20 percent, has gradually seen its market share fall with the rise of local alternatives including Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. The combined share of the four companies stood at 66 percent during the third quarter, though the figure is predicted to decline to 57.3 percent in the fourth quarter due to Apple’s upcoming iPhone X, according to the report. “It seems almost impossible for Samsung to upend the Chinese smartphone market reorganized by local firms with quality products and affordable prices,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST College of Business. “Since successful Chinese firms are expanding their presence in budget smartphone markets, including India, Samsung and LG’s global presence will shrink further unless they secure competitiveness against Chinese firms.”Samsung cut around 20,000 jobs in China over the past two years and replaced the head of its Chinese unit in spring amid weak sales. Meanwhile, Samsung’s rival Apple was the only foreign brand in the top five in China.

"I moved to this country in mid-October 2013 to become the director of the Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research (CAPP) at the Institute for Basic Science at the KAIST campus in Daejeon. Often I am asked why Korea hasn’t earned a Nobel Prize in sciences yet. I believe that a Nobel Prize in science for Korea is just a matter of time. There is so much great work going on here with first-rate scientists that it should happen within a generation. The reason I firmly believe this is because Korea is actually investing in research and development as well as basic science. The latter received a major boost through the establishment of the IBS. IBS is the single most important action taken by the Korean government about five years ago that makes Korea’s chances of attaining a Nobel Prize in science realistic, but this investment needs to stay strong and we need to be patient. The CAPP mainly looks for the dark matter of our universe in the form of axions -- a notion developed by prominent theorists around the world including Korea. Dark matter refers to the substance that is keeping our sun gravitationally bound to the Milky Way galaxy, since Newtonian gravity from stars alone is not enough to do it. In the absence of dark matter our solar system would have been thrown to outer space, away from the galaxy, because it is rotating around the galaxy at nearly one-thousandth the speed of light. If we make a major discovery here, the Nobel Prize is almost certain, and indeed it will rightly belong to Korea since Korean scientists would have made a profound impact on the field. The second major subject of the center’s activities, although smaller than the axion efforts, regards the proton electric dipole moment, or EDM. The proton EDM physics is related to the axion physics, but it can also help explain the so-called matter-antimatter asymmetry mystery of our universe. The above physics subjects are two of the 10 most important questions in particle physics today. We are currently well on our way to developing a state of the art facility that will allow us to dominate axion dark matter research within the next five years. In less than 10 years we plan to answer the question of whether axions are part of the dark matter solution in our galaxy even if they only constitute 10 percent of the dark matter for a wide range of axion masses.Regarding the proton EDM experiment, we are developing several high-tech systems that are required for high sensitivity and we are actively seeking a host laboratory where we can build an all-electric storage ring. Technically, it is within our local capabilities and a proton EDM discovery would boost Korea’s standing, placing it at the forefront of science in the world. I also enjoy being a professor of physics at KAIST where I teach the physics of high precision experiments. During the lectures I teach the students how to increase their own chances of claiming the Nobel Prize. I give them advice on how to choose their research subjects, how to come up with new ideas, how to proceed with developing them, when to discuss them with experts and finally what mistakes to avoid. A major point is that one needs not only be smart but to be intelligent, too. An intelligent person is defined as one who is smart but is also aware of his or her environment, of the trends and critical problems in physics, and socially capable of being an effective leader. An intelligent leader instills confidence in his or her people and motivates them to put in the extra mile to achieve their scientific goals. A modern research center is required to be an innovation hub where taking chances is part of the culture and encouraged, as well as a place where many breakthroughs will materialize. Running a research center solely as a project is a common mistake that often leads to it becoming defunct within the first five-year cycle. Smart people should be given the chance to run R&D programs whose outcomes are not always certain. People should not be afraid to take chances and failure should not be used as an excuse to reduce research funding. One should judge the research program as a whole -- not by micromanaging every small part separately. Basic science should also not be too efficient. There are many examples in which Nobel Prize-worthy discoveries happened with small, curiosity driven projects. For instance, the discovery of buckyballs, which resulted in the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry. It was the result of a side project, as was explained by one of its discoverers, Sir Harry Kroto. Another example is the case of Martin Perl who discovered the tau lepton particle and received the 1995 Nobel Prize in physics. He rejected job offers from top universities and chose a less known one in order to have more freedom in developing his own ideas. He said, “When most of the people go one way, dare to go to a different direction and work on your own ideas.”The core values of our research center are the ownership of physics research programs and the personal responsibilities of researchers. Checks and balances are established, and the administrators are strong pillars of the center, impartial and staunch supporters of the rules and regulations of the IBS. Finally, competition is proven worldwide to be the most effective way to keep scientists abreast with the latest developments and we want to keep a strong international component in our center by recruiting foreign scientists, collaborating with the best institutions outside Korea, and by maintaining a strong presence at international conferences. We are building a strong base on which the future Nobel Prize winners of Korea are going to build on and excel. The days of Nobel Prize-worthy scientific discoveries are not far for Korea.By Yannis K. SemertzidisProfessor Yannis K.

"After South Korea’s Constitutional Court’s decision Friday to uphold the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, the case involving arrested Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong may take a new turn, experts and industry watchers said. In the historic ruling that immediately stripped Park of her power, acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said, “President Park’s direct and indirect support in the establishment of the Mir and K-Sports foundations violated the companies’ property rights and autonomy in management,” referring to the nation’s major conglomerates who were found to have donated billions of won to the organizations in question.The Constitutional Court’s ruling may work in the favor of the businesses including Samsung by reinforcing their depiction as “victims” of political pressure. However, some experts said the decision may not necessarily be beneficial to Lee and may even make it harder for his legal team to prove his innocence in his charges of bribery.“The ruling that the president abused her power can be interpreted as that Samsung is a victim, although it is too early to predict how the ruling will affect the case,” said KAIST College of Business professor Lee Byung-tae. Since the political scandal broke out late last year, Samsung has consistently been claiming that it “did not donate the money in return for benefits but had to give the money due to the pressure.” Samsung, LG, Hyundai Motor and SK all declined to comment, citing the sensitivity of the issue. Other experts suggested the ruling might make it harder for Samsung to demonstrate Lee’s innocence.“The verdict cannot be necessarily seen as beneficial to Lee Jae-yong because the part -- regarding Park’s pressure -- does not specifically single out Samsung,” said Lee Jong-soo, a professor at Yonsei Law School. This is because Lee is suspected of volunteering to financially support Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil in return for favors regarding his managerial succession, he explained. The impact of the ruling on Samsung remains ambiguous as the company’s name was not mentioned, while other companies such as Hyundai Motor, Lotte, Posco and KT were brought up once or twice. Also, the ruling did not mention “bribery.”“Today’s ruling was based on constitutional grounds not on legal grounds. It is too early to make a hasty conclusion about the ruling. It remains to be seen, as the investigation on Samsung is not yet over,” said Jang Young-soo, a professor at Korea University Law School. Upon the completion of the special counsel’s investigation, the scandal has been taken up again by state prosecutors. The first hearing for Lee’s trial was held Thursday. He faces charges of bribery and perjury. Yoon Seok-hyun, a professor at Seoul National University Business School, meanwhile, suggested the constitutional decision may bring immediate hurdles to the countries’ main businesses but may lead to long-term advantages.“Today’s verdict signals that the nation is moving toward economic democracy and reforming corporate governance structure. ...

The conference, entitled “2017 JETS (Job, Exhibition, Tech-Forum, Startup),” set for Thursday and Friday, is expected to lay the foundation for young entrepreneurs who wish to establish their own businesses, amid the growing importance of startups for the national economy. Entrepreneur activities have often led to the creation of jobs and the growth of the economy, KAIST said. In fact, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alone has produced roughly 26,000 businesses by students after graduation, which led to hiring more than 3.3 million employees in the United States. Their annual sales reached $1.9 trillion in 2008, which would place them ninth in gross domestic product per capita ranking, according to KAIST.Beside the science and engineering institute, Stanford University’s alumni have also contributed to creating around 5.4 million jobs in the US, generating $2.7 trillion in annual revenue in 2010. That would be the fifth-highest GDP per capita globally, KAIST added. For such reasons, several universities here have also entered the startup market by running assistance programs and giving consultations for entrepreneurial activities among their students. But the lack of collaborative actions in academia in general to support and train talented students across the nation is a hurdle to the efforts to cultivate favorable and sustainable environment for startups, KAIST said in a press release. To cope with that concern, KAIST’s upcoming conference, JETS, associated with other key science and technology universities, is expected to help people understand the concept of creating businesses more easily and bridge the gap between universities and students when it comes to startups.The conference will also bring opportunities for intellectuals to realize the role of universities for creating new industries and cultivating a sustainable business environment by training talented youth, according to a press release from KAIST. During the conference, participants are expected to attend exhibitions for newly created businesses and their products, as well as lectures and consultations to better understand entrepreneurship and how to start own businesses. Participants are also given opportunities to get sponsored with business incubators that offer a variety of amenities including work spaces and support for activities.

"A casual internet search using Google Scholar yielded dozens of studies citing Namuwiki as a source for their papers. These are not just papers submitted by desperate college students scraping the internet for something to fill their word counts; they include academic journals published by legitimate organizations like the Institute for EU Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“It’s ironic because not even the heavy users themselves would think of it as an encyclopedia” said Park Byung-ho, a professor at KAIST’s graduate school of information and media management. “But the people who accessed the pages by searching the internet may think, ‘Well that’s pretty useful (information)’.” It’s not difficult to see a Korean youngster browsing through wiki pages, lost in a sea of information that is easy to access. Within a page is a word highlighted in blue -- indicating a direct link to another page -- and before you know it, you can spend hours browsing through various pages.“Mostly, it’s because it’s fun. When I’m by myself and have nothing to do, I can always access the Namuwiki and look at the pages,” said 30-year-old office worker Kim Han-ho.Most of the people adding information are people like Kim who, while well educated, are not professionals. Phrases like “It is a popular belief,” “Many believe,” “It is common sense to say,” are used to convey one’s personal belief.What is and is not edited out is decided by how popular it is, not by the accuracy of the information.“Many times, the users get embroiled in what is called ‘editing war,’ in which people erase the information they don’t like and fill the pages with their own opinions. Whoever is tenacious enough to keep on editing wins,” said Kim.Such case is not confined to Korean wiki pages. Even Wikipedia is often subject to “editing wars” when dealing with controversial topics. Wikipedia’s “history” page on US President Donald Trump shows that the entry has been repeatedly edited to add content favorable to, or against the controversy-ridden leader.Among the most glaring problems for wiki pages is that their convenience sometimes blinds the users from realizing how groundless the information they provide can be.In one of the most bizarre incidents, an unidentified user last year on Namuwiki posted a nonexistent concept called “Equalism” -- as opposed to the general concept of equality -- that supposedly was coined in 1996 as an idea to replace feminism. What started as an under-100 word page quickly grew as other users added details like actress Emma Watson allegedly mentioning it in a speech, “10 commandments of Equalism” and how it is referred to as “Equalitarianism” in the “Western academic circles.”The truth -- that “Equalism” did not in fact exist as a concept -- was revealed in January and the “Equalism” page was substituted with one explaining the incident involving the false claim. However, inaccurate information about the so-called “Equalism” concept had already spread to numerous Namuwiki pages on gender issues.How fast the information spread without the users realizing it was fake is an alarming sign of the potential danger of online wiki pages.Professor Park said such phenomenon is common when a new type of media or information is presented to the public. “Back when email was first introduced, there was widespread sentiment that any information that one got through email was legitimate. A few years back, Q&A section on Naver or Daum were regarded as credible even though anyone could give an answer,” he said. “The public tends to overestimate (the credibility of) novel methods.”Many wiki pages do not have a person who can be held accountable for their content. Namuwiki itself claims to be run by a Paraguay-run company called umanle S.R.L., about which no information is provided on Namuwiki.The operators of Namuwiki could not be reached for comment for this article as the page provided no contact information.Park stressed that it is important for the general public to realize that the wiki pages are not a credible source of information and that they have always been intended as a “playground” for sharing tidbits about pop culture.“Namuwiki and its forerunners were never intended to replace the pre-existing encyclopedias. Rather it was a form of community that the users created to just enjoy, joke and have fun among themselves,” he said.",Don’t believe everything you read online,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170323000723&ACE_SEARCH=1
"PANGYO, Gyeonggi Province -- The Gyeonggi Center for Creative Economy and Innovation in Pangyo is one of South Korea’s innovation hotbeds with a unique blending of government and big companies.In mid-November, a group of nine reporters from three countries visited the center and Startup Campus, the largest startup complex in Korea, opened in March 2016, as part of a tour to innovation hubs of Korea, China and Japan. The reporters arrived in Korea after visiting similar sites in neighboring countries - Zhongguancun Innoway in Beijing and Knowledge Capital in Osaka. The passion for innovation was equally full at all venues -- whether it was located in a renovated once-publishing cluster like Beijing Innoway or in a shopping center like Osaka’s Knowledge Capital. But one distinctive trait in South Korea was the presentation, ranging from grandiose buildings to professional curators clad in uniform. Pamphlets were readily prepared in English and female curators helped demonstrate products developed by startups. Even when some of the products did not work, the curator helped leave a good impression with vivid descriptions.But at the end of the tour, no reporter seemed to know how to define South Korea’s innovation and startup drives under the ambitious appellation “creative economy” touted by embattled President Park Geun-hye.Some said the government-led center covered too broad a field, while some questioned why innovative drives had to be spearheaded by conglomerates. Some others also pointed out that the startups in operation at the centers were yet to report noteworthy profits.Starting from September 2014, 18 regional centers of Creative Economy and Innovation opened in the country, with a specialized field and a business group partner. GCCEI, for instance, is in partnership with telecommunications giant KT Corp. A total of 16 companies including Samsung Electronics, Daumkakao, SK Group, Hyundai Motor and Lotte Group are participating in CCEI operation.The recent influence-peddling scandal of Park and her close confidante Choi Soon-sill has led to doubts over Park’s creative economy initiatives, partly due to the resemblance of the initiative and two cultural foundations at the center of the scandal. Choi is accused of collecting funds from businesses for the foundations for personal gains. In the midst of the political scandal, some municipal governments have cut their CCEI budgets, as public sentiment worsened toward Park’s creative economy initiatives. Seoul and South Jeolla Province municipal governments cut back the entire budgets for their centers.But CCEI is likely to continue next year as they secured a budget worth 43.7 billion won ($36 million) from the central government and 11.9 billion won from municipal governments.“No one knows what the future holds for the center, especially beyond 2017, but one thing is clear in that support for startups should continue,” said David Sehyeon Baek, director of global cooperation at GCCEI. “We try really hard every day to help more than 1,500 startups and we are doing so without any political agenda.” Underscoring that CCEI models can also give new opportunities for big companies to seek new business models, Baek added, “It is important to continue these efforts through trial and error instead of scrapping it altogether.”As of December, the 18 centers supported 1,576 startups, provided 21,415 mentoring sessions, and helped develop 13,529 prototypes, according to the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. UlalaLab Inc. a startup founded in 2011 to develop IoT platforms for smart factory, is one of those startups that received support from CCEI. In June 2015, UlalaLab was selected as one of the seven promising startups at K-Champ, run by the GCCEI and KT Corp. and moved in to GCCEI for the following six months. The company was given a chance to deliver numerous presentations in front of politicians, businesses and investors from different countries as the successful case of CCEI.“Gyeonggi CCEI has been a great help in terms of marketing and publicity,” said UlalaLab director Choi Iron Hyun-cheol.For the future of the country’s innovative industry, experts suggest that the drive should become less controlled by or dependent on the government in order to gain a higher competitive edge.“In Korea, startups and innovation are being shut down due to many regulations rather than due to lack of government support like CCEI,” said Lee Byung-tae, professor at Daejeon-based research university KAIST.Lim Jung-wook, managing director of Startup Alliance in Korea, said, “The brand of creative economy might have to change, but efforts to foster startups should continue. Startups are the future of this country.”By Park Ga-young ()","[From the scene] Korea's innovation drive meets hurdle, but startups remain determined",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20161230000435&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Samsung Electronics is facing a patent lawsuit from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology in the US, the institute confirmed Wednesday. KAIST IP, the institute’s intellectual property management arm, said it sued Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm and Global Foundries in a Texas court, claiming they used KAIST’s chip technology without permission. Texas is where Samsung’s Austin chip plant is located. KAIST is a state-run research institute set up in 1971 with the aim of improving research and innovation of the nation’s science and technology.At issue is FinFet, which is a key technology for making processors for smartphones. FinFet is a kind of transistor designed to improve the performance of semiconductors and reduce its power consumption. It was first developed by Lee Jong-ho, a professor of Seoul National University in partnership with KAIST. KAIST IP claimed that it had proposed the technology to both Samsung Electronics and Intel, upon which Samsung invited Lee to carry out a presentation for the company’s engineers. Intel obtained licenses of the technology for its product. KAIST IP claims that Samsung, on the other hand, turned down the proposal but later developed its own technology that KAIST alleges is identical to Finfet. “Samsung was able to reduce the development time and cost by copying Lee’s invention without cost. (Samsung) has continued copying Lee’s invention without authority or proper compensation,” a KAIST IP official told The Korea Herald.Intel is currently providing royalties to KAIST for using the patent.Alongside Samsung Electronics, KAIST IP sued California-based semiconductor foundry Global Foundries, which is also using the technology through a license agreement with Samsung. California-based chip designer Qualcomm, a client of both Samsung and Global Foundries, is also facing a lawsuit. It is also planning to file a lawsuit against Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC as soon as it secures evidence of patent infringement, according to KAIST.Samsung Electronics’ official declined to comment as the lawsuit is ongoing.By Shin Ji-hye ()",Samsung faces patent suits from KAIST in Texas,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20161130000835&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Daejeon Arts Collective will be running a group exhibition from Wednesday, showing off work by 16 artists from Korea and abroad.Although the show doesn’t have a theme, its title comes from a Korean saying about not teaching grandmothers to suck eggs. “The title, ‘Writing Chinese in Front of Confucius,’ comes from a Korean saying which means a talentless showoff telling a master how it‘s done,” DJAC president Rosalie Knaack said. “I think the title can have a different meaning to different artists, but to me it’s a reminder not to take ourselves too seriously. We all are working hard at being artists, but it‘s also important to have humility even when we are putting our work on display.” This is the 10th group show that DJAC has put on together. The group is focusing on putting on two group shows a year, although it has in the past held workshops and individual shows.And in the nature of such shows there is a mix of the newcomers and people who are moving on.Jeremy Coleman, one of the groups newest members, will be showing some dramatic black and white photographs, said Knaack. “In one of her last exhibitions in Korea before returning to South Africa, Leela Bear is exhibiting her embroideries on denim,” she added.Knaack is not one of the artists that will be displaying work at the exhibition, but she picked out some others who were, including Alla Pomonavera, who is running a weekend photography course at KAIST and will be showing some photos taken in Vietnam.“Reginald Hart will be showing three new paintings. While he often works of tones of blue and purple, his painting called ‘Fall Maple’ is vibrant in red and orange,” Knaack added.“Christopher Maslon continues to experiment in the field of screen printing. This time he has incorporated spray paint in his animals series.”“Writing Chinese in Front of Confucius” runs at the South Chungcheong Provincial Office Gallery from April 19-27. The gallery is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. There will be an event to introduce the work on Saturday from 5 p.m., including a performance art piece, with artists on hand to explain and answer questions about their work.By Paul Kerry ()",Daejeon Artists stay humble for group show,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170418000883&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Samsung Electronics’ facial recognition technology requires more than four years to be solely used for mobile payment, a source from Samsung and industry watchers predicted on Monday. Facial recognition is considered the next-generation biometric technology as it is more convenient than an iris scanner or fingerprint. It can be certified by simply looking at the smartphone instead of positioning your eyes in a small section of the screen or moving your finger around trying to locate the scanner. The facial recognition technology was adopted for Samsung’s flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 and it is also expected to be used for Apple’s new handset iPhone 8 to be unveiled later this year. Despite the convenience, Samsung’s facial recognition technology is not yet mature enough to be solely used for high-level security such as financial transactions. “In order for facial recognition to be solely used for financial transactions, it would take more than four years considering the current camera and deep learning technology levels,” a source from Samsung told The Korea Herald. Samsung admitted Galaxy S8’s facial recognition is made only to conveniently unlock the phone and it has a lower security level compared to the iris scanner and fingerprint technologies. “We do not need to use facial recognition for mobile financial transactions because there are already high-level biometric technologies such as iris and fingerprint recognition. The question that when it will be used is meaningless,” a Samsung spokesperson said. Korean card companies including Samsung, KB, Hana and Lotte said they are not currently in discussion with Samsung Electronics in terms of using facial recognition technology for their financial transaction. Still, experts view the future biometric technologies will gradually move toward facial and voice recognition due to their convenience and universality. They are more convenient as users simply look at the screen or speak and more universal because most handsets have cameras and microphones. Not many phones have iris sensors or fingerprint scanners. “Facial and voice recognition will also be mainstream in the future alongside iris and fingerprint. But, it needs more than four to five years for facial recognition to be solely used for financial transactions. For the time being, they will be used as additional certification methods,” Jin Seung-heon, a chief of Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute’s information protection research unit.In March of 2015, Chinese tech giant Alibaba demonstrated its facial recognition technology for financial transactions during computer expo CeBIT for the first time in the world. But, it has not adopted the technology for any handsets yet. Samsung has been adopting fingerprint sensors for its mobile payment Samsung Pay for Galaxy S6 in 2015 and iris scanners for the discontinued Note 7 and Galaxy S8.“The fingerprint scanner has not frequently been used for Samsung Pay because it was not as convenient as expected. The use of biometric recognition will depend on how companies can make more convenient and advanced technologies,” said Lee Byung-tae, KAIST College of Business professor. Korea Internet & Security Agency predicts that the Korean biometric recognition market will increase to 270 billion won ($239 million) in 2020 from 180 billion won in 2015. By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)",Samsung’s facial recognition not ready for mobile payments,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170425000884&ACE_SEARCH=1
"President Moon Jae-in is expected to encourage mergers and acquisitions, deregulate Internet of Things-related laws and abolish joint surety to boost startups.There has been consensus among experts here that more decent jobs should be created from startups and small and medium-sized businesses to reduce excessive dependency on conglomerates dominating the gross domestic product in creating jobs and conjuring up new growth engines.“The M&A market must be activated like that in the US. That would be the way for large companies to pay a proper price in buying startups, and for the startup companies to use the money to continue making new ideas,” Moon had said during an economic forum last month. He was seemingly referring to cases of Silicon Valley tech giants, such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Intel, paying hefty sums to buy small startups. Industry watchers expect the Korea Fair Trade Commission to be overhauled under the new administration, as Moon earlier had said he would expand its investigation authority to correct unfair business practices by large companies. “In Korea, large companies don’t need to spend hefty sums of money because they can simply take startup’s technologies. Infringement of patents is relatively well tolerated here compared to the US, where hefty fines are imposed on such unfair practices by corporate watchdogs,” Park Tae-geun, public relations chief of the Korea Venture Business Association, told The Korea Herald. Apart from M&A, experts have also been calling for deregulation of public data, which most startups need to provide new services based on artificial intelligence and big data technologies. “Despite the growing potential of data use among startups, a lot of the data -- financial, education and health care -- are unable to be put on cloud servers by law under the pretext of security reasons,” said Lee Min-hwa, a professor at KAIST Business College and chairman of the Korea Creative Economy Research Network. Lee said such strict laws make it difficult for startups -- mostly online firms -- to create new services. In Korea, data traffic on cloud environment out of total data traffic is 1.4 percent compared to the OECD average of 86 percent, Lee said citing the data by Cisco Systems and telecom operator KT. Shin Sang-yeol, a chief of Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning’s software promotion division, pointed out, “Lee’s views on deregulation of cloud-related policies are generally right. Still, the general perception of personal information protection is too conservative in Korea to open all the public data radically.” Apart from the technology-related laws, financial deregulation on startups are also expected to be made under Moon. During his presidential campaign, Moon had pledged that he would completely abolish joint surety. Joint surety system refers to a unique policy in Korea placing the blame of company bankruptcy on its chief regardless of causes of the failures. As a result, failed CEOs often end up with huge debts.Moon earlier had said, “In Silicon Valley, there is no case a company makes a success on the first attempt. They usually make a success after one or two failres. An eco-system should be made for an entrepreneur to make a new attempt even after failures.”Last year, the government allowed its guarantee funds, including Korea Credit Guarantee Fund and Korea Technology Finance Corporation, not to require joint surety for companies established less than five years. The range of the companies is expected to be expanded under Moon’s administration. “The abolition of joint surety has so far been opposed by financial authorities on the grounds of moral hazard. However, further abolition is expected under the new administration because the measure has made many failed entrepreneurs delinquent borrowers who are given no second chance,” said Lee Won-seob, Korea Federation of SMEs’ policy division. By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)",[Moon in Office] M&As to be encouraged to boost startups,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170514000256&ACE_SEARCH=1
"How do we perceive the world? Information in the external world, i.e., sensory information, needs to be actively processed in the brain to be transformed into a “percept.” Sensory processing (computation of sensory stimuli in the brain) is the gateway to sensory perception, and efficient sensory processing is required for the perceptual behavior of the animal. How do our brain circuits execute this amazing function? We answer this question by studying cortical circuits that control animal perceptual behaviors. To survive in a complex and changing environment, animals must dynamically adjust their behavioral states, rapidly switching into alert, attentive states upon task demand. Perception of the sensory information initiates the task, and the complex sensory information must be reconstructed fast in the cortical circuits to generate a single percept. Cortex is divided into multiple regions with distinct functions, and sensory modalities are processed in different cortical areas, which consist of similar microcircuits with population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. How does then the cortical network process fast reconstruction of the multi-sensory information? To answer this question, I aim to unravel neural circuits for sensory processing, integration, and modulation. The results will recruit attention from the field by opening a new scope on the brain mechanism of sensory integration. My plan is to build on my prior work and further develop my independent research career in neurobiology of cognition by investigating the functional organization of specific cell types and circuits. I will combine state-of-the-art molecular, physiological, and behavioral techniques to bring key advances in our understanding of the neural basis of perceptual and cognitive behavior. Such insights should be broadly applicable to the treatment of cognitive disorders including Alzheimer‘s disease, attention deficit disorder, autism, and schizophrenia, which are often correlated with the disruption of neuromodulation and cortical processing.By Dr. Lee Seung-hee Dr. Lee is an assistant professor at Department of Biological Sciences at KAIST. --Ed.",[Contribution] How do we communicate with the sensory world?,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170522000580&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Shim Jae-chul, 57, had to find a new way to make a living when he lost his job three years ago. To restart his career, Shim chose to take online courses to obtain an electrician’s certificate. “I had to find a new job to support my family. However, people who are old like me have problems learning as quickly as young people,” Shim said. “Online courses let me review materials repeatedly. I can even slow down the speed (of the lectures), which is great!” According to the recent survey conducted by Mirae Asset Global Investments, workers in South Korea retire from work at the average age of 54. Most retirees seek to start a second career. Shim was once the head of his department at a leading conglomerate in Korea. When he was 55 years old, he came under pressure to quit, but he was not financially prepared to stop working. He decided to take online courses from a lifelong education institute. Getting a new job or better position is a problem that goes beyond the older generations. Younger people in their 20s or 30s also face the same problem. They are now paying attention to lifelong education, often in the form of online programs. K-MOOC, which stands for Korean Massive Open Online Course, has been available since October 2015, with support from the Ministry of Education and National Institute for Lifelong Education. Over 140 web-based courses from local universities such as Seoul National University and KAIST provide free learning to students, regardless of age or nationality. “As of February 2017, more than 125,000 users have learned via K-MOOC,” Suh Heon-joo, executive director of K-MOOC said. “Our system helps students to engage in interactive learning such as discussions, quizzes and offline activities. Suh said the age of the students ranges from 20 through 50, and more teenagers are opting to take K-MOOC courses. A 32-year-old woman, who requested anonymity, said she worked at a law firm and takes online classes from the Cyber University of Korea. “My work sometimes requires foreign language skills but I was afraid to speak a foreign language,” she said. “I’ve been taking the foreign language courses for two years and now I’m getting more confident and I also got promoted.” The Cyber University of Korea said that 12,000 students are enrolled as of March. The university said electrical and electronic engineering is one of the most popular courses. Female students who had quit their jobs to take care of their children are favoring counseling and health-related courses to prepare for a job search. Not all MOOC students are concerned about getting a job. Suh Young-wan, director at Lifelong Education of Konyang Cyber University, said students in their 50s and older are showing great passion for lifelong learning.

"The South Korean Army on Saturday held its first conference on military drones, at which researchers rolled out drone-related studies such as development on so-called “suicide drones.”The event was hosted by the conference held at Korea Army Intelligence School, in charge of training intelligence officers in the Army. Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, refer to aircraft that require no human pilot with varying degrees autonomy in their operation. Their uses vary from military use to aerial surveillance, filming, search and rescue, cargo transportation.  Shim Hyun-chul, a professor of aerospace engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said KAIST had been developing drones that can be used to carry out military missions. This includes research and development of suicide drones, which are remotely guided to a target and set off an armed device upon reaching it. “KAIST lab has been carrying out studies on using drones for attacks since 2014. ... We conducted a test flight under supervision of the Agency for Defense Development in November of 2014,” he said.Shim also revealed the photos of the test flight, adding that the researchers were working on detection and tracking of the target, along with automated landing technologies for the drone.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation, there are currently 895 UAVs being operated in the country. The drone technology on the military front dates back to the 1970s when the ADD sought to introduce a miniature air launch decoy codenamed “Solgae.” While the project never fully took off, the ADD and the Korea Aerospace Industries launched Korea’s first homegrown UAV RQ-101 “Songgolmae” in 2001. Shim pointed out that combat drone technology had made strides over the past 30 years, with drone roles expanding from mainly reconnaissance to striking enemy bases. He explained that there had been a worldwide move to develop unmanned combat aerial vehicles with stealth capabilities. This includes the Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus, a demonstration UCAV model.Brig. Gen. Moon Seong-cheol, principal of the school, stressed the importance of drone technology in the military and said that the Army planned to make the conference an annual event. There has been a security concern on the peninsula recently over reports that objects suspected of being North Korean drones have infiltrated across the border. The South Korean military officially denied that any drone had passed the inter-Korea borders since Jan. 13, and reiterated that it is on constant surveillance against North Korean drones.In a closed-door press briefing, the military added that it plans to raise required operational capability of its air defense radars -- which currently detect aircraft -- to also detect smaller drones.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)",Army holds conference on military drones,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160403000307&ACE_SEARCH=1

"A future preparation committee affiliated with the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning on Wednesday announced 10 promising services that would help the Korean economy to grow even in an era of low growth. The services include: customized health care; cashless financial transactions; unmanned transportation; crisis response using the Internet of Things; life extension; electricity charging; eco-friendly energy platforms; artificial intelligence; energy supply for wearable devices; and learning from social network services. The committee publicized a report, titled “New Normal Growth Strategy,” based on a survey of 932 tech experts and academics. The report also analyzed when the services could be commercialized and how they would change society. According to the report, the global economy has entered a low-growth phase since the financial crisis in 2008, as low growth, low product prices, low interest rates and high jobless rates have become the “new normal.” The report said Korea should ramp up efforts to counter low growth and find new growth engine businesses.

"In 1990, South Korea-based Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIST) opened a computer room wit 25 PCs, when the country was only taking its first steps towards emerging as the world's leading player in information and communications (ICT) technology.Song Jae-kyung, then a young graduate student in his 20s, was in charge of managing one of the country's first Internet cafes.Only a few years later, Song, now 49 years old, changed the history of South Korea's gaming industry by developing the country's first Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in 1996, dubbed ""Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds,"" locally known as ""Baram."" Nexus reached the U.S. market in 1997.The ground-breaking program is now considered the longest surviving online game in tech-heavy South Korea. It also won a Guinness title as the oldest MMORPG in 2011 to mark its 15th anniversary.The accumulated number of users came to 23 million, which accounts for nearly half of South Korea's population of 50 million.On average, each user played the game for three hours on a daily basis.Nexus operators said while some were concerned that Nexon would make only a penny from the old program, the company is actually seeing better-than-expected profitability.""Baram as we know it today was based on the participation of many developers, and not just myself,"" Song told Yonhap News Agency. ""But it is true that many were pessimistic about 'a game like this' back then. I was so proud to find a breakthrough.""The first-generation of Internet users in South Korea cheered Nexus upon its release. Many users were willing to bear monthly data fee of hundreds of thousands of won in the 1990s, just to play the never-before-seen game.Nexus began its full-fledged growth in the late 1990s following the boom of Internet cafes in South Korea, which made online games more accessible to a wider scope of users, including students without PCs at home.Song started his dream of becoming a developer when he first encountered a computer in the early 1980s as a middle school student. Although he did not have one for himself, Song eventually became enthusiastic about computers and studied them.""After I first learned about computers, I was immersed in playing games. But I was not too good at them, especially for those that called for quick responses. I am so bad at strategic games like SimCity or StarCraft. But I was good at role-playing games that called for diligence,"" Song said.In the late 1990s, South Korean online users were enthusiastic about the so-called ""Multi User Dungeon (MUD),"" which refers to text-based multi-player games. While users could communicate with each other, there were no graphics to be shown, and participants had to use their imagination.Another popular type of game was the first-generation role playing game, which boasted graphics but could not feature multi-player mode.Then came Nexus, which allowed multiple users to enjoy high-end graphic content at the same time. It is considered the first-generation of MMORPG, although the term did not exist back in 1996.""In the 1990s, the speed of modems was very slow. Even the delivery of text was very slow. Due to those circumstances, many claimed that a graphic-based online game was technologically impossible. And I thought I could, and I did,"" Song said.Song sought to solve the slow Internet speed by having users pre-download graphic data on their computers. Song began his project to develop Nexus after dropping out from KAIST and working at Hancom Inc., a South Korean software developer. He joined forces with Kim Jung-ju to start Nexon Corp. in 1994. For Song, however, Nexus was an unfinished task. A few months ahead of the official release, Song left Nexon in December 1995, and the project was carried on by other developers. Nexus helped Nexon to emerge as an online giant from a young startup.In September 1998, Song also gave birth to Lineage, another MMORPG, at NCsoft Corporation. Song then left NCSoft to start his own business.Song now heads XLGAMES Inc. Although the company's first racing game failed to gain popularity, its own MMORPG ArcheAge became a hit in the North American and Chinese markets. The company posted an operating profit of 1.2 billion won ($1.02 million) in 2015.Amid the boom of smartphones, which did not exist 20 years ago, Song is currently working on developing his first mobile role-playing game, which will be similar to Nexus.On his humble desk with nothing else other than his computer with two monitors, even now, Song is sharing his idea with 10 younger developers, continuing to expand his dream, which all began when he was a simple graduate student. ""The only good memories I have right now was when feeling relieved after solving programming-related problems everyday during the development of Baram,"" Song said. ""Now I want to think only positively. I am happy to still have an opportunity to develop games.""

"More than 120 university leaders from around the world gathered for an annual forum in Seoul on Monday to promote better mutual cooperation on research and to look for new innovative roles of educational institutions in new-generation industries.Hosted by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, the 2016 International Presidential Forum on Global Research Universities kicked off with about 120 presidents and vice presidents of 65 research universities from 36 countries, including three Korean colleges. The annual forum, established in 2008, aims at promoting excellence and innovation in higher education with presidents of leading research universities and key policymakers in the private and public sectors from around the world. The event has allowed participants to share their expertise, ideas and practices taking place in the academia, industry and government. “This year’s forum will offer an opportunity to explore the future of research universities and to discuss the best ways to bring synergy with the government and the industry,” said KAIST President Kang Sung Mo. Under the theme of “Social Responsibilities of Higher Education and Strategic Global Partnership,” the two-day forum consists of presentations and discussions in five sub-topics. They include: “Seeking a new model of research universities in a new era”; “Shared challenges and responsibilities from a global perspective”; “Strategic global partnerships for sustainable development”; and “Insights into higher education: trends and development.” The seventh forum has recorded the largest number of participants, including 28 European schools, 20 Asian institutions and eight schools from the Americas. They include: University of Waterloo president Feridun Hamdullahpur from Canada; Aalto University president Tuula Teeri from Finland; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology president Tony F. Chan from Hong Kong; Georgetown University senior vice president Spiros Dimolitsas from the U.S.; King’s College London vice principal Joanna Newman from the U.K.; and Nagoya University vice president Hideyo Kunieda from Japan. “I believe the number of participants reflects a sense of urgency that global universities share. One way or another, we must adapt to the rapidly transforming educational and research environment encompassing higher learning,” said Myaeng Sung-hyon, the associate vice president of the international office at KAIST and a cochair of the forum.The forum kicked off with a special session over the importance and methods of collaboration between the industry and universities. The session was attended by several Korean industry officials, such as Lim Tae-won, the chief technology officer of Hyundai Motor Central Advanced Research and Engineering Institute, as well as school leaders.On Tuesday, a number of leaders will address participants as plenary speakers, including KAIST president Kang, Ecole Polytechnique president Jacques Biot from France and Israel Institute of Technology president Peretz Lavie. Kang will introduce KAIST’s educational philosophy and its latest endeavor to turn a university-led entrepreneurial activity into a stable business based on research outcomes and campus innovations. As of 2013, KAIST graduates founded a total of 1,245 companies, generating about $1.5 billion in revenue and creating 34,000 jobs, the school said. KAIST, a public institute founded in 1971, was ranked No. 6 in the Times Higher Education ranking of the 150 world’s best young universities this year. This is the fifth annual ranking of universities under 50 years old. Kang was inaugurated as the 15th president of the school in 2013.Biot will offer a glimpse of his insights into how the fourth industrial revolution will impact the future of global research universities and the importance of schools’ multidisciplinary approaches to tackle societal challenges. Lavie will describe the strengths of the public and academic programs that have fostered an “innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem” in Israel. He will explain how the school has become a key player in the growth of Israel’s industry, science and technology based on interaction between the government’s four specific support programs and the incubating system. Since 1995, the school graduates have run more than 2,000 companies, adding some 100,000 jobs and $30 billion through mergers and acquisitions, the school officials said.

"The Korean government has rolled up its sleeves to develop more advanced supercomputing systems than AlphaGo after the artificial intelligence by Google’s DeepMind defeated the nation‘s human Go master last month.Behind the learning and calculation prowess of AlphaGo are supercomputing systems made of more than 1,400 central processing and graphic processing units and application software.The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning announced Monday a plan to invest a total of 100 billion won ($87.2 million) -- approximately 10 billion won a year -- for the next 10 years to develop high-performance computers, or supercomputers, which will incorporate up-to-date system and application software.The ICT Ministry will first develop a supercomputer that can manage 1 petaflop per second (a quadrillion calculations per second) in the first phase of the state-run project from this year through 2020, and then a supercomputer that can perform 30 quadrillion calculations, or faster, from 2021 to 2025.China’s Tianhe-2, which has topped the global supercomputer list since 2010, boasts a performance of 33.86 petaflops, almost twice as fast as the runner-up Titan of the U.S.The Korean ministry said it will combine dispersed government institutions and research centers for development of supercomputing systems to create a single control center.The ministry had worked with academia, tech companies and experts, including Seoul National University, KAIST, SK hynix and Gluesys, to come up with the plan to vitalize the domestic supercomputer industry.The state-run research institutes, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information developed Maha in 2015 and Baram in 2014, respectively. Seoul National University also developed supercomputer Chundoong in 2012. However, they have been outgunned by Chinese and U.S. peers, failing to make the world’s top 100.Market research firm IDC forecast that the world’s supercomputing market and segments for relevant technologies, including servers, storage and software, will grow from $32.2 billion in 2014 to $43.4 billion in 2018 -- average annual growth of 7.8 percent.Some industry officials said the government will have to put focus on providing well-balanced support for both hardware and software.“Developing a fast computer is easy. The more important thing is to develop system and application software that can maximize computing power,” said Kwon Dae-seok, the chief of the AI and supercomputer developer Clunix.“The amount of money that the ministry has promised to invest for supercomputing systems is not enough to grow both hardware and software for state-of-the-art supercompting systems,” he added.The U.S., the long-term leader in supercomputing before being dethroned by China, has recently been pushing to regain its past glory as the forerunner in the global supercomputer segment.U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order in July 2015 to operate a federal research, development and deployment project for the world’s first exascale (1,000-petaflop) computing system.By Kim Young-won ()",Government to invest W100b to develop supercomputers,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160404000865&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Samsung Electronics confirmed Tuesday that it has bought Korean artificial intelligence startup Fluenty in a move to boost its AI capabilities. Samsung’s mobile unit has taken over the fledgling firm, which has around 10 employees who are mostly former developers at Korea’s two largest search giants, Naver and Kakao, according to local news reports. This is the first Korean AI startup acquired by Samsung, which mainly invests in and acquires foreign tech companies. In 2015, Fluenty unveiled a smartphone app called “AI-based Recommendation Service” in English, which recommends appropriate responses to users based on machine learning. For instance, when someone sends a message saying “How about lunch today?” the app recommends replies such as “Yes. Which menu do you want?” or “I will adjust your schedule.” The Korean version was launched last year.Fluenty’s app supports most messenger services, including Kakao Talk, Telegram, Line, WhatsApp, Facebook and short message service. Samsung is expected to incorporate the startup’s technologies into its AI voice assistant service Bixby. “Samsung is now aggressively expanding its AI capabilities by taking over related manpower and organizations, as it views that the technology will be applied to all areas in the future,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST College of Business.“The recent takeover is seen as a good sign for other local startups, as Samsung appears to be willing to buy any company -- whether local or foreign -- if they have advanced AI-related original technologies,” he added. Last week, Samsung announced it had created an AI center under Samsung Research. Samsung Research was relaunched last month by integrating the firm’s Digital Media & Communications Research Center and Software Center to strengthen advanced research related to artificial intelligence. Following the acquisition of the US startup Viv Labs last year, Samsung unveiled Bixby in April for its flagship smartphone Galaxy S8.

"South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it plans to gradually abolish the military’s special rule that allows the conscripted to provide alternate services in lieu of mandatory military service from 2020 to 2022.The plans for the phaseout are due to the country’s dwindling population.“The military speculates that there will be an annual shortage of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers (by 2023), even considering that the military will be downsized to around 520,000 by then,” said a ministry official.As South Korea is technically still at war with North Korea -- the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty -- all able-bodied men are mandated to serve in the military, ranging from 21 months to 24 months. But an annual average of around 28,000 people are able to serve in alternative fields. The main beneficiaries are students from natural science or engineering majors who are allowed to continue research or work at institutes each year, but there are others allowed to assist in the jobs of police, the coast guard, firemen and other workers in public sectors.The official explained that by requiring these men to serve in the military instead, the military will be able to resolve the shortage in soldiers.The ministry stressed that the plan was not yet set in stone, and that it is still holding consultations with the public organizations that employ the conscripted.The plan immediately sparked backlash from science and engineering majors here.Student councils of technology schools including the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said they plan to hold a signature-collecting campaign and press conferences in protest of the plan. KAIST’s student council said that most of the school’s students will be affected by the change that they said would disrupt the continuity of their education and research, and negatively impact the entire field of science and engineering. Past administrations have suggested abolishment of the alternative military service system, but such plans were thwarted mainly by financial restraints. Wages for the mandatory servicemen -- regardless of their field of work -- is around 178,000 won ($152) per month. The legal minimum monthly wage for a 40-hour-a-week job is 1.26 million won.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)",S.

"[Reshaping Semicon Map]With increasing efforts to promote its semiconductor industry at the government level, it may be possible for China to step closer to first-tier technologies by 2035, according to a Chinese professor who is known as a “semiconductor tutor” to President Xi Jinping. Wei Shaojun, dean of the department of micro- and nano-electronics at Tsinghua University, said it is true that the Chinese government is aggressively moving to foster the integrated circuit industry with a huge investment fund worth 138 billion yuan ($20.9 billion) by 2020, and such a move by the world’s biggest chip market will bring changes to the global market. “It may be possible for China to step closer to first-tier technologies by 2035,” professor Wei said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Nov. 7, after he attended the IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference in Seoul.However, he stressed, “It is not a threat to the world market. It is just a new normal.” “In the past three years, there was a lot of discussion about China’s semiconductor industry, including both positive and negative aspects,” the professor said. “Many from the US worry about the booming of China’s semiconductor industry. China is booming. It is not a threat; it’s just a normal rise and development of industry. Don’t worry about that.” China has been the world’s largest IC market since 2013. As the biggest producer of mobile devices and consumer electronics, it is crucial to global chip giants such as US-based Intel and Korea-based Samsung Electronics and SK hynix. As of 2016, the Chinese IC industry’s revenue stood at 433.55 billion yuan, growing 20.1 percent from the previous year. Despite the rapid growth, internal evaluations of the industry were poor due to the fact that a mere 160 billion yuan, or 25 percent of the market, was created by Chinese players. “China imports around 65 percent of semiconductors from outside, and some people worry about importing too much,” Wei said. “From outside, they also worry from a different angle about China’s purchases. What if China one day stops buying?” The trade imbalance in the IC industry triggered the Chinese government to come up with a national plan for promotion of the industry with the following goals: reach 1 trillion yuan in revenue by 2020; start mass production of chips on 16- and 14-nanometer process technology; target global markets for mobile devices, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and big data systems on chips. “China’s booming IC industry will give everybody an opportunity for collaboration,” Wei said. “Many foreign companies like Intel and Samsung are developing their businesses in China, taking advantage of China’s big market and favorable government policies, including tax incentives and free use of land and public infrastructure.” Looking at the history of the world’s semiconductor industry, leading trends and market leadership have been transferring from the US to Europe, from Europe to Japan, then from Japan to Korea. And recently, Taiwan is apparently trying to take over some areas. Wei believes it is time for China to transform the global market by taking over its leadership. But he acknowledged China would need at least 15 years to reach closer to state-of-art technologies.“I am not sure whether this transfer will be successful or not, but the government is very aggressively moving to promote the industry,” the professor said. “What we can do for sure is to make efforts not to widen the technological gap with leading countries. We are keeping at it about 10 years at the moment.” As first-tier chipmakers are facing greater complexity in developing cutting-edge technologies down to single-digit nanometers, the growth in the technological gap between China and other countries could slow down, providing a chance for the Chinese to catch up.  “I’ve proposed to the government to pay more attention to fundamental research in order to boost the industry,” he said. “It should invest in what will drive the industry 10 years later.” As the biggest producer and consumer of electronics goods, Wei forecasts that the growth potential of the Chinese IC industry lies in the mobile, IoT and consumer electronics markets. “There will be areas of collaboration between Korea and China for future growth of the IC industries of both countries,” Wei said. “Both governments can create a fund at the national level in terms of R&D, human talent and joint businesses, with an aim to create a new market.” By Song Su-hyun ()",[Herald Interview] China chip tech to catch up by 2035: expert,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171126000148&ACE_SEARCH=1

"South Korea’s leading science and technology research university KAIST said Wednesday that it will host an “AI World Cup” in which teams of artificially intelligent robots compete in a miniature soccer tournament.The AI soccer tournament, which the university says will be the first of its kind to take place internationally, will be held Friday at the KI Building in Daejeon. Teams of five bots employing AI-based machine learning algorithms including Q-Learning -- a reinforcement learning technique used to automatically determine the optimal behavior within a specific context -- will be competing. Contrary to some expectations, the AI bots will not be “humanoid robots” that look and act like humans. The bots will come in the form of 7.5-centimeter cubes, passing around a ball of 4.27 cm on a 220-cm-long field, KAIST said. Eighteen soccer teams will compete. Of them, eight are from KAIST, including one team jointly formed by KAIST and Seoul National University. The remaining 10 teams come from Mokpo National University, Kyungpook National University, Hanyang University, Chonbuk National University, Yeungnam University, Sungkyunkwan University, Kyung Hee University, Keimyung University and Modu Labs.The top team in AI soccer will receive a cash prize of 10 million won ($9,240), while the second-place team will be awarded 5 million won. Third and fourth place will each win 1.5 million won.In addition to soccer, separate teams will compete in the categories of “AI sports commentary” and “AI sports news reporting.” The commentator bots will be judged by a panel of experts on how accurately and naturally they describe the gameplay and make predictions.The reporter bots will be evaluated on the accuracy and informative degree of their articles, as well as article structure and readability. They will also be evaluated on how similar their works are to articles produced by human journalists.The best AI commentator bot will be awarded 2 million won while the top AI reporter bot will receive 1 million won. Four teams are competing in each category, organizers said.Building on this year’s success, KAIST hopes to launch the same “AI World Cup” on an international level in July 2018, said professor Kim Jong-hwan, dean of KAIST’s College of Engineering and director of the tournament.

"Korean chaebol -- family-controlled conglomerates -- are rushing to capitalize on K-pop which is steadily gaining global popularity. One example is LS Group. Koo Bon-woong, the grandson of late LG Cable & System honorary chairman Koo Tae-hoe and eldest son of LS-Nikko Copper chairman Koo Ja-hong, recently invested in a new K-pop related Korean venture firm called My Music Taste.The younger Koo is already well-known as the cofounder of investment firm Formation 8, which previously made a high-profile investment in Oculus VR that eventually gained high returns. On Jan. 8, Formation 8 and seven other venture capital firms, including Softbank Ventures, Samsung Ventures Investment, and Chinese DT Capital, invested $10 million in crowdsourcing platform My Music Taste, or MMT. MMT is a platform that analyzes the demand for K-pop concerts abroad and eventually plans them. Thus, different from usual concerts, fans do not crowd after a singer has decided to hold a concert but instead invites the celebrity to their town. With currently over 500,000 subscribers from around the world, MMT successfully held over 80 concerts in 30 cities. Popular boy-band INFINITE and Block B were able to hold concerts in Europe through this crowdsourcing platform service. Because the K-pop industry is gaining popularity around the world and with no other service providing such information, Koo decided on the investment seeing the potential for growth.MMT is a burgeoning international platform, with 95 percent of its users coming from abroad.Its parent company JJS Media was cofounded by Lee Jae-seok in 2011. After graduating from KAIST and working as a MapleStory game developer at Korea’s largest game developer Nexon, Lee founded JJS Media realizing the lack of platforms that connect the audience and production agencies. He has since started to supply audience demand for concerts through JJS Media. Before investing in MMT, Formation 8 invested in other companies. Cofounding Formation 8 in Silicon Valley in 2012, Koo has since ventured into the private equity industry and invested in around 80 start-ups -- including $15 million in Korean mobile service company Yellow Mobile in 2014. Its most well-known investment was $12.5 million in virtual reality technology company Oculus VR, that was later acquired by Facebook in March 2014, which increased the investment profits tenfold to a jaw-dropping $130 million. It remains to be seen whether this investment in the K-pop industry will outdo or even reach the same amount of success as seen in the virtual reality sector.By The Korea Herald Superrich Team ()-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hong Seung-wanCheon Ye-seonSeo Jee-yeonYoon Hyun-jongMin Sang-seekLee Seo-young",Chaebol investing in K-pop industry,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160524000443&ACE_SEARCH=1

"It took a weeklong match in March this year between 18-time world Go champion Lee Se-dol and Alphago for it to hit South Koreans hard: Human beings could actually be replaced by artificial intelligence.Alphago, the AI Go program developed by Google DeepMind, won four out of five games. The initial anticipation of Lee’s sweeping victory soon turned into self-assuring consolation that he at least managed one win. “After the match, I was actually fearful of my own arrogant assumption that a man-made AI would never outperform a human,” said Kim Sung-jin, a 33-year-old researcher in material engineering. “When an AI accumulates sufficient data, its accuracy and speed could outshine many human scholars.” In the age of the smart machine, the world is experiencing changes in the way humans live, work and interact with others driven by technological advances in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the “Internet of Things,” 3-D printing, data storage and genetics. The changes are disruptive enough for Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, to coin the term the “4th Industrial Revolution,” or “Industry 4.0.”  While the rise of AI and robots has significantly helped human beings complete their tasks, it poses a worrying question: What impact will Industry 4.0 have on jobs?According to a “The Future of Jobs” report published by the World Economic Forum early this year, as many as 7.1 million jobs could be lost in 15 major economies by 2020 through redundancy, automation or disintermediation, with the greatest losses expected in white-collar office and administrative roles.The loss could be partially offset by the creation of 2.1 million new jobs, mainly in more specialized sectors such as computer, mathematics and engineering, the report said. In the book “Rise of the Robots,” Martin Ford has pointed out that robots are likely to replace such white-collar workers as teachers, journalists, lawyers and others in the service sector as new technology makes their skills -- more technical than creative -- less valuable. Local experts noted that cutting-edge technologies will substitute human labor, but remained cautious about predicting whether the country will gain or lose jobs overall. “New technologies lead to job losses, but also creation of new jobs, though it remains to be seen whether the digital revolution will make up for the job destruction.” said Lee Byung-tae, who teaches Internet technology at KAIST Business School. “But the challenge human beings face today is that we are unable to cope with fast-evolving technologies, fast-disappearing and appearing jobs.”“For now, Korea should be more worried about overseas competitors as it is losing jobs to developing countries more than to new technologies as companies seek to relocate their factories to lower production costs.” Park Myoung-soo, a researcher at Korea Institute of Science and Technology, noted that automation complements labor. “Workers will rather move to creative sectors than be excluded from labor,” he said. “They will be able to focus their energy on coming up with useful new ideas and machines will implement the ideas.” “The reasons why robots prevail in many domains are they are speedier, more powerful and more accurate than men,” Park said. “But it is still human beings who decide how much freedom they grant to robots and who embed rules in software.” According to a report by the Korea Employment Information Service in March, mostly low-skill, low-wage jobs involving repetitive tasks would disappear in favor of automation in an imminent future.Concrete producers topped the list of jobs to be replaced by AI robots by 2020, followed by butchers, rubber and plastic producers, security guards and tax administrators. The data, analyzed based on a model by Oxford University’s Michael Osborne and Carl Frey, also showed that professional workers such as loss adjusters (ranked 40th), doctors (44th) and air traffic controllers (79th) were at relatively high risk among other specialized occupations to be taken over by the machines. Those in careers requiring human interaction and negotiation skills, such as actors, artists, musicians and photographers, were less likely to be replaced by machines.Park Ka-yeol, a researcher at KEIS, contended that clerical and manual jobs are at a higher risk of being replaced because AI robots are better than human beings at repetitive tasks with job definitions that are simple and clear. “Human beings will excel at projects that are difficult to understand under existing rules and require creative, artistic perspectives,” Park said. “Only jobs that boost mankind’s happiness and require teamwork and interaction with other individuals will survive.” Park noted, however, that the Korean labor market might be vulnerable to such changes because it is heavily reliant on administrative jobs and lacks a talent pool of experts in technological sectors. “Workers will be able to work with and make use of machines to improve labor productivity in the new age of machines,” he said. “Simpler tasks should be given to those with less experience while professionals should focus on doing complicated tasks, which will eventually reduce working hours per person and lead to job-sharing.” Cheon yang-ha, who teaches computer science at Yongin University, said that laborers themselves should be more prepared through education so as not to be excluded. “As barriers among industries collapse in the age of new technologies, workers should receive education on a regular basis to learn about not only new technologies but also other sectors such as finance, medicine, humanity and law that can fused with technologies.” According to a survey released by Swiss bank UBS shortly before this year’s World Economic Forum, Korea ranked No. 25 among 139 countries in terms of its ability to adjust to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It was measured in five categories: labor market flexibility, educational system, infrastructure, technological ability and legal protection.Professor Lee of KAIST Business School underscored the need to reform heavy regulations and the labor market to make it more flexible and create jobs in uncertain times. “As people don’t need to work as much as they used to, jobs should be shared. For that, the country should encourage companies to create jobs by making the market more flexible,” he said. “With the help of technologies, companies should create a flexible working environment where more women and elderly can find employment. They can work from home part-time, for example.” The technological progress and automation, however, will inevitably lead to greater inequality among workers, companies and countries, another expert pointed out. “The adaptability to use technologies will create a digital divide, though it will eventually be narrowed in a few decades,” said Kang Jeong-soo, a director of Digital Society Institute. “Rich companies invest more in developing technology, which will further sharpen their competitive edge. Skilled workers who can develop and control machines will earn a lot more income (than the rest,)” he said. “And the gap will be already too big to close.” Lee Il-young, who teaches economics at Hanshin University, said that technological developments have been associated with capitalist leaders, excluding laborers. “Technological progress could play out in an undemocratic way unless the government intervenes and creates a fair system. For example, Web users create content, but it is portal sites who monopolize profits,” Lee said. He cited the weak status of Korean workers, with a third of workers being temporarily or indirectly hired, and the large gap between small-sized companies and large firms, which he said will only worsen along with technological progress.“Technology itself is neutral. It is human beings’ job to set fair rules and lead the technology in a positive direction so that everyone can share the prosperity,” he said. “South Korea will not be able to adapt to the new digital age and will lag behind unless it changes the old way of top-down governance, government monopoly of authority and conglomerate-centered business ecosystem.”By Ock Hyun-ju ()",[Industry 4.0] How will Industry 4.0 impact jobs?,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160811000632&ACE_SEARCH=1
"[] It took a weeklong match in March this year between 18-time world Go champion Lee Se-dol and Alphago for it to hit South Koreans hard: Human beings could actually be replaced by artificial intelligence.Alphago, the AI Go program developed by Google DeepMind, won four out of five games. The initial anticipation of Lee’s sweeping victory soon turned into self-assuring consolation that he at least managed one win. “After the match, I was actually fearful of my own arrogant assumption that a man-made AI would never outperform a human,” said Kim Sung-jin, a 33-year-old researcher in material engineering. “When an AI accumulates sufficient data, its accuracy and speed could outshine many human scholars.” In the age of the smart machine, the world is experiencing changes in the way humans live, work and interact with others driven by technological advances in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the “Internet of Things,” 3-D printing, data storage and genetics.

"Korea’s top 100 rich list is dominated by chaebol families, but there is one self-made man who has made it on to the list, Kim Jung-ju. At 49 years old, Kim is the chairman of NXC, the holding company of Nexon, which is the representative figure of the online game industry.According to The Superrich Team’s “Korea’s Richest 100,” Kim has 2 trillion won ($1.7 billion) worth of assets through his ownership of unlisted companies. He ranks 12th as of Jan. 30 on the list.Kim does not own any share of the listed firms, but is the largest shareholder of Nexon’s unlisted holding company NXC with 48.5 percent of shares. When standardized by total ownership interest, his shares are worth approximately 2.7 trillion won.Adding the 21.15 percent of shares held by his wife, director Yoo Jung-hyun, Kim owns 69.65 percent of the total shares. Her assets standardized by total ownership interest are worth at least 900.9 billion won.Nexon Group has a vertical management structure with Kim at the center. NXC, whose ownership is dominated by Kim, exerts its influence over the other subsidiaries. Under NXC is the Japanese corporation of Nexon, followed by Nexon Korea. Kim’s wife has been involved in the business since the establishment of Nexon in 1994, and has played a significant role in its development as the director of the headquarters’ management support team. Not much information has been revealed about Yoo even within the company and thus, she is known to have a more secluded type of authority than her husband.Kim met Yoo during his freshman year at Seoul National University, and the couple has two daughters.Kim does not appear upfront in the management, but as the largest shareholder, he is seen to have an actual influence over the company. Recently, he was implicated in the Jin Kyung-joon scandal, and had faced the biggest challenge since the company’s establishment as he went through several prosecution investigations.Kim was accused of providing free shares and overseas traveling fees to Jin, a former prosecutor and a fellow colleague of Kim’s from SNU class of 1986. Kim was pronounced innocent on the first trial that took place on Dec. 13 citing lack of evidence being linked to business favors. But he faces an appeal.Jin was sent to trial for receiving 900 million won worth of monetary benefits including funds to purchase the share of Nexon Japan, a Genesis car, and overseas travels. The court decided that the shares and traveling fees that Jin received from Nexon were not for the purpose of bribery.The industry sees that Nexon will turn towards aggressive investments in order to regain its competence in the global gaming industry after Kim’s long trial.Kim is indeed well-known as the “master of investment” as he enlarged Nexon through merge and acquisition strategies. Through NXC’s investment-focused subsidiary NXMH, Kim took over the online Lego trading website Bricklink in 2013, and in the same year, he also took over Norway’s global baby products enterprise Stokke. In August 2015, he also invested in the social commerce enterprise WeMap through NXC.Also, he has partnered with American venture investment firm Collborative Fund since 2014. The fund has collected $33 million worth of capital to invest into various startups. Kim has invested in diverse sectors including the electronic car industry, a lunar module company and four future food companies. In particular, Kim is said have received advice from his father in his business ventures. Kim’s father, Kim Kyo-chang, is a corporation lawyer at the law firm Jeongyul.After graduating from Seoul National University as an undergraduate of Computer Science and Engineering major, Kim Jung-ju finished his masters and doctorate degrees at KAIST school of Computing. In 1994, he founded the online game company Nexon, which was an unfamiliar industry back then. His father was a strong supporter of his son who was walking such an unaccustomed path of establishing a game enterprise. He reportedly loaned his son 60 million won as business funds which Kim spent to find a studio in Yeoksam-dong that was used as an office.  Nexon first came up with the world’s first graphic Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games “The Kingdom of the Winds” in 1996 and “Crazyracing Kartrider” in 2004 which were huge successes, and allowed the company to become the largest game company in Korea. At the end of last March, Nexon Group owned 55 corporate bodies, 17 domestic ones and 38 overseas.During the first five years of its establishment, his father played the role of a consultant dealing with diverse contracts as a representative of Nexon.Senior Kim was born in Seoul, and graduated from Seoul High School and Seoul National University majoring in law. In 1962, he became a judge at Seoul District Court and in 1966, he opened a private practice as a lawyer while serving as the president of the Korea Parliamentary Law Institute and Korea Notaries Association.By The Superich Team Min Sang-seekYoon Hyun-jongYim Ji-min ()","[Superrich] After acquittal, Nexon founder sets out for new future",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170202000644&ACE_SEARCH=1

In the ’80s, when personal computers were still a rarity, Kim had the luxury of owning one. While tinkering on it, he decided to become an engineer of a sort.At the same time, he was also an accomplished violinist, according to those close to him. In elementary school, he won a violin competition, and is also known to have taken several professional-level music classes in college. In short, he was a cultured nerd. Kim eventually graduated from SNU, then went onto KAIST graduate school.It was in 1994, when Kim was barely 30 years old, that he created the online gaming company Nexon. His first big break came two years later in 1996 with the hit RPG game, “The Kingdom of the Wind.”It remains hugely popular to this day, with the accumulated number of subscribers reaching 23 million -- South Korea has a population of 50 million.Other games such as “Maple Story” and “Kart Rider” would later go onto become best-selling hits for Nexon.But the man behind this success for most part kept to himself.Kim stayed out of the limelight, right until the latest scandal involving prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon erupted. One reason he could avoid attention was because Nexon was listed in Japan. Nexon Japan shares were listed on Tokyo’s main bourse in 2011, and market capitalization at the time stood at 8 trillion won (US$7.04 billion). Prior to that, in 2005, Nexon was split into Nexon Holdings -- the precursor to current holding company NXC headed by Kim -- and Nexon. The entirety of the Nexon’s Korean office was sold to Nexon Japan. NXC, the holding company, is wholly owned by Kim, and it holds a controlling stake in Nexon Japan, which in turn controls Nexon Korea. As of June this year, his net worth reached 1.8 billion dollars, according to Forbes.

"Linking with overseas institutions to allow students to cultivate a global outlook and network with business leaders is a growing trend at universities here.KAIST College of Business runs the China-Korea-Japan Field Study Program involving three institutes: China’s Tsinghua University, Korea’s KAIST and Japan’s Keio University.This year, it invited some 40 Master of Business Administration students from the three universities to Korea from July 8-16 for them to conduct joint research on Korea’s small enterprises and exchange ideas from a pan-Asian perspective. After visiting six enterprises here, three of the students sat with The Korea Herald for an interview on KAIST campus in northern Seoul to share their experiences and thoughts on Korea’s business environment. “I wanted to learn about Korean and Chinese companies’ strengths (by interacting with Korean and Chinese students),” said Handa Mayuka, a Japanese student doing an MBA course at Keio University. “Japanese (tend to) focus on details and academic solutions, while (the) Chinese are more interested in practical solutions. Koreans are balanced by pursuing both.” Pan Lei, a Chinese private banker pursuing an MBA at Tsinghua University, noted Korean companies’ globalization.“Chinese companies are big in size and mostly cater to customers in China because the market is big enough for them to grow,” Pan said. “But for Korean companies, the Korean market is not big enough, so I think they are much more globalized and tend to focus on business-to-business rather than business-to-customer marketing.” “We are different, but I think all the three countries share a similar work culture,” he said. “We are quick in setting a goal, making a decision and getting a task done as a team with one voice.” Huang Dean-yuan, a Taiwanese-Korean student doing a MBA course at KAIST, said he was impressed by Korea’s small companies aggressively expanding their sales channels. “I also learned that Korea’s small companies are flexible and offer work-and-life balance for their employees,” he added. The students offered ideas on how Korean companies can thrive further.“For Korean small companies not to be too reliant on large conglomerates, they should build their competitiveness and flexible work culture to attract competent laborers,” Handa said. Pan added, “It is important to achieve economies of scale to cut costs and make themselves powerful enough to compete on the world stage.” KAIST College of Business, which opened in 1995, is a Seoul-based graduate school affiliated with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The school has been ranked first in Asia five consecutive years based on the Financial Times rankings and provides part-time and full-time MBA programs in finance, IT, environment, corporate social responsibility and media.

"South Korea’s Ministry of Education will conduct a study of gifted students following their academic and career path for 25 years after their graduation from state-run special education programs, it said Wednesday. The subjects of the survey -- the first of its kind here -- are 15-year-olds or 16-year-olds who enter eight science high schools here this year. The study will run through 2041 until they reach 40 or 41. “We have analyzed short-term data on the effect of special education for talented students, but have never conducted a follow-up survey for such a long period,” Cho Eui-jung, an administrative official of the Ministry of Education told The Korea Herald.  With the envisioned research, the ministry aims to analyze the effectiveness of the country’s specialized education programs and how their beneficiaries contribute to the society, she said. Korea introduced special education programs for talented students in 2002, amid growing calls to systematically train and nurture them from the early stage of education. In the first year, the number of students who qualified for special education was about 10,000, 1 percent of all primary, middle and high school students. But the figure had risen tenfold to 109,900 by 2015, according to the ministry data. The special education programs are also under scrutiny, with some saying it promotes private education spending on children by parents who wish to send their kids to the institutes. Others point out that many of the graduates from the programs end up pursuing lucrative jobs rather than further developing their respective special gifts, with many of them entering medical colleges. Among the eight schools subject to the government body’s upcoming long-term survey are the Seoul Science High School and Korea Science Academy of KAIST, an affiliate school of the country’s leading science and engineering university, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The participants of the research will be surveyed for the next 25 years under the consent of their parents, on the development process of their specific talents, external influences that affect the process, their academic achievements in higher education and their careers after college.

"DAEJEON — A medical device startup born from an applied physics lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology is out to introduce a next-generation 3-D microscope that uses light to observe living cells in real time.Founded in 2015, Tomocube has developed a new holographic microscope that shoots weak laser light through samples of live cells and tissues. It uses their refractive index — how much the light bends, or refracts, when passing through a medium — to construct a three-dimensional image of their structure and internal properties.The technique does not require any physical “labeling” or “staining” of the cells. Existing devices require injecting a fluorescent material into the cells and shining a strong light through them -- a process that often kills the cells or alters their original state.“We expect our device to become highly useful in fields like cell biology, immunology and hematology as well as new drug development and medical diagnoses,” Tomocube’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Park Yong-keun told The Korea Herald.Park, who holds a Ph.D. in medical engineering from Harvard University, has dedicated much of his academic career researching photoptics. After joining KAIST’s physics department, Park built the initial prototype of its light microscope. He decided to later commercialize the device, establishing Tomocube.Tomocube’s “label-free” microscope, the HT-1, uses a self-coined technology called “holotomography,” which merges holography -- the photographic recording of a light field -- with computed tomography, or CT technology.Just as a CT machine emits beams of X-rays through a patient’s body by revolving at a 360 degree angle, Tomocube’s device shines laser beams through a live cell or tissue at a 360 angle.The HT-1 calculates the refractive values of these light beams to construct a 3-D image of these cells. It can also determine structural and chemical information, including their mass, morphology, protein concentrations and changes within the cellular membrane.Most importantly, Tomocube’s light microscope lets scientists monitor how a cell changes over time -- whether on its own or in reaction to a foreign substance -- by conducting repeated light scans at fixed intervals.“By using light, we can calculate a cell’s mass and track its internal dynamics by monitoring how different substances within a cell change over time,” Tomocube co-founder and CEO Hong Ki-hyun explained.“This type of data is particularly important and useful when observing interactions between two cells, or between a cell and a substance (such as a drug),” Hong said.For instance, Tomocube’s device could be used to discern the effects of a new drug on a patient’s liver. It could be used to analyze how fat within the cell decreases in reaction to the drug over time, he explained.Because oil and water have differing masses, their refractive indexes also differ. By tracking the changes in the masses of the fat molecules inside a cell, one can discern how a drug is affecting its target.A large pool of data on how a particular cell changes over the course of time -- when combined with image recognition capabilities powered by deep learning -- is also expected to help researchers detect early signs of diseases such as cancer, Hong said.The HT-1’s ability to scan live cells with the same amount of light at constant intervals could help automate the cell observation process as well, he added.Tomocube’s technology has already caught the attention of investors. The startup has attracted more than 4 billion won ($3.46 million) from Softbank Ventures Korea, Hanmi Science, the parent company of Korean drugmaker Hanmi Pharmaceutical and InterVest.As of now, Tomocube has sold or freely provided for research purposes some dozen HT-1 units to universities and hospitals in Korea and abroad. It is now working to obtain the needed certification from multiple regulatory bodies to commercialize its light microscope in the US and Europe. In doing so, CTO Park has already published more than 60 research papers detailing research studies conducted using the HT-1 to build up a pool of use cases for its new device. As it prepares to expand sales, Tomocube expressed confidence in the competitive pricing of the HT-1, which has adopted a significantly cheaper price than that of existing devices in the global market.Conventional light microscopes that use “staining,” sold by international medical device giants like Olympus, Nikon and Carl Zeiss are currently priced at between 200 million won to 500 million won, the startup said.“Until now, these high-priced devices were primarily used at research labs as they were the best option available in the market,” said Hong. “We’re hoping to break this with an alternative, cost-efficient device.”The company’s proposed target for this year is to sell at least 100 devices and record around 3 billion won in revenue, according to Hong.“Our goal is to rise up as the world’s No. 1 holotomography company. We hope to become a notable example of a high-tech medical device company hailing from Korea,” the two co-founders said.By Sohn Ji-young ()","[Health-tech Korea] Tomocube’s light microscope enables realtime, 3-D observation of live cells",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170305000069&ACE_SEARCH=1

"DAEJEON – Although he has not taught classes in the spring semester, the office of KAIST professor emeritus Kim Yang-han looks busy, books stacked on the desks. He was reading about how Friedrich Nietzsche’s use of a typewriter changed his writing style when I arrive for the interview on June 7. The German philosopher’s switch from writing longhand to using typewriter profoundly influenced how he wrote, says Kim. Kim is preparing for his class next semester where he will teach about the relationship between art and mechanical engineering. “I decided to change the course title to ‘Picasso’s Engineering School,’” Kim says. This sounds a lot more intriguing than “Learning mechanical engineering through Western art,” as was initially suggested. Kim is what many would typically call an “elite.” He graduated from a prestigious high school in Seoul, studied mechanical engineering at Seoul National University and went onto MIT on a highly competitive state scholarship. At MIT, he specialized in acoustical engineering and received his doctoral degree in 1985. While many of his peers at the time chose to remain in the US upon graduation, Kim returned to Korea to join the KAIST faculty. He had interviewed for a position at a university in Rhode Island and that evening he called KAIST to accept its offer. “The interview went well. There was an informal gathering of professors in the evening and it was then that I realized that I did not belong,” he says.He has been at KAIST ever since. He is Korea’s leading expert in acoustical engineering and has developed Virtual Sound Ball, a 3-D effects technology which stays near a listener at multiple angles. He has also invented a “spatial equalizer” that allows devices to control the sound ball.What prompted the engineer’s interest in art? A professor of mechanical engineering teaching that has anything to do with art, after all, is not common.“It was in 1987 and I had arrived early for an academic conference in Amsterdam. So I happened to visit the Van Gogh Museum,” he says. What was an unplanned, casual visit held an epiphany for Kim. “I was surprised. Van Gogh made numerous sketches. I felt he must have studied, practiced a lot. It inspired me to focus even more on the basics,” he says. From then on, he began looking at art with greater attention.Oblivious to the numerous art institutions of Boston while a graduate student at MIT, his eyes were now open to the rich cultural offerings of the city. Whenever he attended conferences, he made sure to visit the cities’ museums. “About 10 years ago, on a visit to Penn State University, I made a stop in New York to see the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. I went there for three straight days,” he says. Once again, he was struck by the Van Gogh pieces. Observing the paintings closely, he saw the dynamic brush strokes. On a trip to Zimbabwe, he was introduced to Shona stone sculptures. He still remembers the local artists telling him, “The sculpture is already there in the stone.” Once he had seen Shona sculptures, he was able to see the Shona influence in Picasso’s works. “Picasso, like Shakespeare, copied and appropriated,” Kim observes. Kim is much in demand as a speaker and his calendar is filled with lecture engagements where he is asked to talk about art and engineering. He began lecturing on a similar theme about two years ago. Kim suggests his lectures are popular because they deal with the meeting of two different concepts -- Western art and mechanical engineering. “It sparks people’s curiosity,” he says, adding with a chuckle that since there are no experts in this field, he is free to explore the subject. He has even had proposal from a publishing company for a book on engineering and art, an offer he declined. “I realized that I wasn’t up to it yet.”Knowing that the best way to learn is to teach, he proposed the class combining art and engineering for the upcoming fall semester. “Why am I doing this class? What motivates engineers today is very different from my time,” he says. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a national drive to promote industries and export and the highest caliber students went into engineering. “There was a strong social message that we must study engineering. It was ingrained in me that since the country lacked natural resources, we needed to make good products to export,” he says.Kim expressed disappointment with engineering students of today. “High caliber students do not go into engineering because there is no future in engineering. If you join major conglomerates, you retire at 50. Starting your own venture company is hard. There is a crisis in engineering,” he says.As for Kim, he finds engineering studies very interesting. “It is a creative job,” he says, pointing out that mechanical engineering is about creating something that people need. “It is a creative process, very similar to painting,” he says. In both fields, you need to study, practice, study other examples and that is how you arrive at a design imbued with your own original thinking, he explains.He cited the example of Flemish painter Rubens as an artist who did a lot of collaborative work with other artists. In Paik Nam-june, the late Korean video artist, he sees an artist rebelling against TV, while at the same time expressing the new human with TV art. “Technical innovations result from seeking ways to break away from limitations,” he says. “My message is you can be a Van Gogh, a Picasso. Steve Jobs was similar to Van Gogh and Picasso,” Kim says, reiterating that creative thinking arises from close observation and continued practice.“My audience, who are mostly engineers, are receptive to this message. I want to give a message of hope to young people,” he says. A piano sits in the lobby of the engineering department building which is free for anyone to play. A mini concert is held Fridays. It was Kim’s idea to have a piano in the lobby, he says, an effort to bring the arts closer to engineers. “To do something creative requires an understanding of people, and understanding people requires an understanding of art,” he emphasizes.“My audience, who are mostly engineers, are receptive to this message. I want to give a message of hope to young people,” he says. “Retirement is a scam,” says Kim, who explains that it is possible to be stay engaged after turning 65, giving an automotive analogy: “A fellow professor once said that retiring is like re-tiring.”By Kim Hoo-ran ()",[Eye] Acoustical engineer marries arts and engineering,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170616000610&ACE_SEARCH=1
"As apprehension spreads among ordinary mortals over the rise of artificial intelligence to replace humans, social diversity would be the key for people to brace for the next AI generation, Korea’s renowned neuroscientist said.“Current rote-learning method that unilaterally crams knowledge into people’s brains is nothing but an attempt to train the ability that can be replaced by AI. People should come to think of the opposite question: ‘How can we have different experiences and viewpoints?’ Because this is the core of creativity that allows to control and utilize AI,” computational neuroscientist Jeong Jae-seung at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Jeong, a bio and brain engineering associate professor who originally majored in physics at KAIST, received a Ph.D. from the alma mater with a thesis on computational modeling of Alzheimer’s brains. The 44-year-old expanded his study to psychiatry when he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University School of Medicine and an assistant professor at Columbia University. His main research topics include human decision-making, brain-robot interface and brain dynamics. Having been recognized for his work, Jeong was picked as one of “Young Global Leaders” at the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, in 2009. He became a public figure with a series of best-seller books on science and psychology that fluently elaborated on the otherwise perplexing concepts of the fields.Witnessing the landmark Go matches between Google’s AI named AlpahGo and South Korea’s Go champion Lee Se-dol in March, he emphasized that the game was a very safe chance for the public to realize how powerful AI could be if it goes through reinforcement learning or deep learning. In the end, the future will be greatly influenced by the combination of AI, Internet of Things and big data, the professor added. “The uncut versions of human behavior will be embodied in the IoT and social media in the future, and AI will learn and analyze that behavior, figure out what people desire and come up with customized services beforehand,” he said. He, however, pointed out that people’s concerns over AI replacing people’s jobs is exaggerated. “AI has yet to have motivations or desire. There is no need to personify it. Just like other scientific technology, AI will be of very useful means.”Yet, he stressed that human control is essential. “The use of AI will be most effective in the medical or health care system. But it cannot serve as a tool once the procedure gets complex. The scientific technology can be used as a tool only when humans have a control over it,” he stressed. “The more complicated AI becomes, the more often humans will follow its decisions without being aware of how such decisions are made, and also face difficulties in finding its faults. “We may be in the same situation as Aja Huang playing Go as directed by AlphGo,” he said, referring to the Google DeepMind programmer and amateur 6-dan Go player who was placing stones on behalf of AlphaGo.Some have raised concerns that robots will ultimately turn into a new “governing class” that controls humans. Jeong, however, underscored that a more serious concern in the AI world will be the digital gap among humans.“It’s critical to think of how to solve the gap between those who are able to utilize AI and those who are not. The ‘digital divide’ is already visible in society as the classes are formed by the difference in technology adaptability.” Right after the AlphaGo match sparked an AI wave here, the Korean government vowed in March that it would launch an AI technology research center with support from conglomerates. Establishing a separate AI team within the Ministry of Science, the government said it would inject 1 trillion won ($840 billion) in the industry for the next five years. It also said a 15-year long-term measures will be drawn up later this year. Jeong hailed the government’s large-scale investment plans but remained cautious over the way they are state-driven. “The government’s aggressive investment must be carried out for sure. But once the government attempts to lead the way, reaching the goals will be difficult. No scientific research can be completed with a single vision. It is important that that government maintains a distance by making the investment but not interfering with the industry,” he stressed. While continuing his studies on brain-machine interface and brain-inspired AI, Jeong participated last year in the government’s project of analyzing problems and issues that the country will face in the future. The project covered what kind of lifestyle the country has to seek and how scientific technology will play a role. As one of the project members, the professor predicted that more attention will be paid to the quality of life. “The Korean society severely lacks a lifestyle that values the quality of life, which will lead to the rise of desire and demand for it. The most important value called happiness has become the most difficult thing to achieve in Korea. ‘Scarcity’ of happiness will make the society to desire the happiness,” said Jeong. “Scarcity” is what the neuroscientist has emphasized whenever he holds a public lecture. “Achievement is initiated from voluntary motivation. These days, many parents provide their children in advance with what they may need, giving them no chance to truly desire something. They may go to good schools and get good jobs. But such a life without desire can hardly make great achievements,” he said. “One of the things that AI does not have but humans do is ‘voluntary motivation.’ Only people with enough voluntary motivations can make great achievements, and scarcity is what drives such motivation.”As part of his studies analyzing the human decision-making process, Jeong is now working on a dissertation on how patients with depression or anxiety make decisions to commit suicide. “Not all depression patients kill themselves. If it is possible to predict their suicidal risk, (the society) will be able to provide due care for them. Curbing the suicide rate is one of my academic goals. I would like to contribute to solving problems associated with serious decision-making such as suicide,” Jeong said.

"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed the world’s lowest-power-consuming artificial intelligence chips for facial recognition, the institute announced Tuesday. The “K-Eye” series has a wearable type that looks like a necklace and a dongle type that can be connected to a smartphone like a portable USB drive. The wearable K-Eye chip can also be connected to handsets via Bluetooth.  The chip requires around 1 milliwatt of electricity to fully operate and recognize the user’s face at up to 97 percent accuracy. The amount of power required is about 0.0002 percent of the power consumed by the central processing unit of Google’s AlphaGo. The core technologies embedded in the K-Eye series are the institute’s Always-On image sensor and facial recognizing processor chip CNNP. The sensor itself can recognize users’ faces, reducing power waste. The CNNP operates on its own based on a deep-learning algorithm. The chips are expected to help operate a mushrooming number of new AI software programs on mobile devices, which usually require huge power for implementation, the institute said. By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)",KAIST develops power saving AI chips,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170613000832&ACE_SEARCH=1

"SK Telecom said Wednesday it was granted permission by the government to test autonomous cars on public roads using Hyundai vehicles. SKT, which is the first local mobile carrier to gain the approval, said it plans to develop a self-driving car with Hyundai’s luxury vehicle Genesis G80 in partnership with Seoul National University and the US chipmaker Nvidia. The latest announcement is part of the firm’s self-driving efforts, which include unveiling the 5G connected car solution T5 in partnership with BMW in November last year and a partnership with Nvidia in May to jointly develop autonomous driving technologies. “We will mainly focus on developing artificial intelligence software, a 3-D high-precision map solution and 5G vehicle-to-everything technology to improve autonomous driving safety,” a SK Telecom spokesperson said in a statement. The 3-D high-precision map solution captures images of objects smaller than 25 square centimeters, enabling a car to avoid obstacles that are too small to be captured by existing map solutions available in the market. The 5G vehicle-to-everything technology, or 5G V2X, is a network allowing cars to exchange traffic information real-time with vehicle control centers and traffic lights to prevent accidents. The 5G network allows faster communication with a response time of less than 0.001 second. SKT also plans to use big data accumulated from its mobile navigation service, T-Map, to develop a self-driving algorithm to upgrade AI software. T-Map currently has more than 10 million monthly users. Apart from the telecom company, the nation’s academics, automakers and tech giants have recently jumped into the self-driving race. This year alone, ten organizations, including Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, Mando, Seoul National University, Hanyang University, KAIST, Naver, the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics were granted permission to test self-driving cars on public roads.

"The organization will enable the country to gird up for unpredictable incidents such as a close encounter between its science satellite and a space object last year and the crash of an unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft early this year. “The military will now be able to forecast the passing of satellites of enemies and neighboring countries, as well as space climate conditions, and thus better support military operations in the air, on the ground and at sea,” the Air Force said in a statement. “As all cutting-edge weapons systems currently being utilized by all military organs are based on satellite communications information including GPS, they can serve their causes only when the satellites are intact above the Earth.” The center will also boost related cooperation with the U.S., such as by sharing information on possible collisions with cosmic objects and assisting each other’s launches of air vehicles and their potential deviation from orbit and reentry. Last September, South Korea’s Air Force and the U.S. Strategic Command agreed to share advanced space monitoring data in line with an accord between the two countries’ defense ministries. “We have until now lifted off satellites without detailed purposes and strategies. With the operation center, we can integrate various information gained from satellites into useful data, while significantly raising our situational awareness in collaboration with the U.S.,” an Air Force official told The Korea Herald on customary condition of anonymity. To facilitate its space programs, the Air Force clinched agreements with the Korea Meteorological Administration, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, KAIST and KT Sat, a leading satellite operator.

"“The Martian” is a science fiction novel by American author Andy Weir. I read the book in an electronic version on my Kindle over a period of three days. It is a book that’s hard to put down. But before I go any further, here’s a warning: anyone planning to read this novel or watch its film adaptation due out early next month will be advised to avoid reading this spoiler-infested column.Now that you’ve bravely decided to read on, I feel much better talking about the fascinating storyline of “The Martian.” It’s about a make-or-break situation: you are left alone in a remote place for some reason, and have to survive -- and remain sane -- until somebody else comes down to save you.Our hero, NASA astronaut Mark Watney, is in this extremely harsh situation. He gets stranded on Mars when his colleagues of the Ares 3 mission evacuate their landing site as a result of an unexpected dust storm that threatens to disrupt their return flight.Watney is presumed to be dead, but as with other heroes in the literary genre, he turns out to be alive, only with a minor injury. So far, so good. What’s a bit tricky is that he is unable to contact Earth and yet has to find a way to survive on Mars with limited resources.Watney thankfully records his castaway experience in a journal for future space archeologists. His log entries are full of surprises, reflecting his creative tricks that remind me of MacGyver.Watney’s resourcefulness has to do with his two specialties -- he’s a botanist and mechanical engineer. The mix of the two professional knowledge bases allows him to grow potatoes (yes, on Mars!) and fix machines and gear to lay the foundation to increase the odds of survival.What helps Watney to tinker with all the high-tech spacecraft devices is the standardized parts with the same valve. NASA scientists apparently believe that a standard interface not only increases efficiency but also boosts the chance of impromptu recombination of parts suitable for emergencies.The standard valve Watney utilizes -- the universal building block -- comes in handy. When I was attending a biology class in Daejeon as part of a Science Journalism graduate course at KAIST two weeks ago, the same principle came off as intriguing. All living organisms on Earth have the same DNA molecules, using the same four-letter code composed of the same nucleotide bases. What a neat idea, I thought, while reading the novel on my Kindle in different places such as the living room, on the subway and the toilet.The word toilet evokes a sad memory about what I had gone through -- an ordeal that might be similar to what Watney endured.Back in the 2000s, I got a chance to visit Boston to write on Lycos, a search engine company, with other Korean reporters. One night, we had a late dinner and drank together way past midnight. As Watney does every day on Mars whenever nature calls, I also made my way to the toilet, only to realize when I came out that other reporters already got on to the rented bus and returned to the hotel. I was utterly stranded at an obscure bar in Boston, without any clue about the location of my hotel or its phone number. As with Watney on Mars, I had no way to contact other reporters or a guide or a bus driver. I had to use what I had to find a way back to the hotel. It was a terrible experience (though, it’s really funny whenever I recall the toilet-sparked castaway experience).What I can spill about “The Martian” is that its storyline is far better than my sorry state in Boston. And I felt thankful again for the Kindle that I could use to read English-language novels and nonfiction with the simple click of a button. I’m not a big fan of Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, but I think highly of the universal (at least in English language) e-book device and the standardized platform.The success story of “The Martian” author Andy Weir is also closely linked to the Kindle. Weir, who calls himself “a nerd,” put his book in a serial format one chapter at a time for free on his blog. As his online novel gained more readers, some requested Weir put together his installments in a Kindle format. He set the price of the Kindle version at 99 cents. The rest is history: 35,000 copies were sold in three months, sending the title to the best-selling list, and a publisher and movie producers rushed to sign a contract with the little-known author, who never imagined renowned director Ridley Scott would take the helm of the film adaptation, starring Matt Damon. In a scene on Mars where free time is aplenty (thanks to the disconnection with other people), Watney reads all the books and watches all the old TV dramas and listens to all the songs left by other crew members. The scene made me ponder what I would bring with me, if I am given a chance to pick only one item when I get stranded in a remote place. I might go for the Kindle filled with lots of fantasy novels in order to forget about my hopeless state; what will be your Watney-on-Mars item?By Yang Sung-jin",[Yang Sung-jin] Precious items for a castaway,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150916001189&ACE_SEARCH=1
"After losing his father to a stroke and watching two uncles give up on expensive treatment for the same thing, engineer Ban Ho-young sought to create a disruptive technology that would make rehabilitation easy and affordable for any patient.He and cofounder Choi Young launched Neofect to create a smart rehabilitation glove that helps doctors analyze patients’ progress while keeping stroke patients motivated by helping them regain their arm and hand skills through activity games. After four years of development, the team rolled it out for sale last year.The product, Rapael, has been sold to over 20 hospitals in Korea, and the pending home-use version could allow patients to continue therapy on their own between doctor’s visits for just 50,000 won a month. But Ban says his start-up and other medical-tech peers are squeezed by Korea’s legal gray areas, quick-buck investors and rising production costs.“Regulation is not always wrong. We need regulation to protect people,” Ban told The Korea Herald in an interview last week. “But in the current situation, there is ambiguity about new, innovative technology. If we know the line, we can fit to it, but regulations are not catching up.”Tough health care regulations make new technologies difficult to introduce, especially when several government bodies are involved, he said. The lack of agreement about the privacy, ownership and use of private data, for example, prevents Neofect from analyzing big data from hospitals to determine the best-fit trends, which the CEO said could enhance research and treatment for both doctors and tech developers. Korea’s ongoing debate over telemedicine and remote health care is also hindering patients from using Rapael at home, Ban added. With today’s rehab methods, patients can lie about doing their home exercises, but Neofect’s technology makes activities easy to track, he explained. Having a doctor involved in the home-care version to communicate with the patient would be preferred, but Neofect is seeking to separate the two to work with the regulations, he said.Even while he sees that Korean consumers tend to be open to new technologies, the law is wary to adapt to them, and private venture capital funding even more so, Ban claimed.Despite schools like KAIST churning out top-trained engineers ― including Neofect’s founders ― Ban noted that medical hardware isn’t a hot segment in Korea like e-commerce or gaming, where Coupang and 4:33 Creative Lab are among the top-funded start-ups. Health care start-ups, which need lots of time and money for development, often struggle to get off the ground as local investors are wary of making long-term plays without promising data and in the face of unclear laws. They opt for faster results in mass consumer services, especially considering the relatively small size of Korea’s health care market compared to its economy, Ban said. According to the World Health Organization, Korea’s health care spending stood at 7.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, compared to 17.1 percent in the U.S. and 10.3 percent in Japan.Conditions are worsening for hardware start-ups of all types, as small factories are shuttering in Korea and moving to China, making small-order prototypes more expensive, he added.“It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” Ban said. “I understand the investors’ side. ... In the U.S., there are many health care start-up companies that have made big returns. In Korea, there’s nothing.”Time will tell whether Korea can produce a successful role model to pave the way for local health care innovators, as both the start-up and venture capital ecosystems are in very early stages compared to those in the U.S., Ban noted. The government seems to be filling in the financing gap with grants and the Tech Incubator Program for Startup angel investment-matching fund, he added. Conditions for private funding could improve in some 10 years, he said, but Neofect won’t wait for Korea to catch up.“Even though we are here in Korea, we are dreaming of the global market,” Ban said. “I want our product to benefit patients worldwide (who have suffered from) a stroke or Parkinson’s disease or dementia. I want our service to help the people who need it. That’s our vision.” It is targeting sales of Rapael’s business-to-business product, which runs at around $10,000, in Europe, the U.S. and China. Neofect also incorporated in San Francisco to seek out a strategic investor and foster its network in the U.S. “We want a perfect world, but there are always limitations. But we have to pursue our vision within the limitations. That’s the role of a company.”For more information, visit neofect.com.By Elaine Ramirez (elaine@heraldcorp.com)",Gray areas hinder medical tech innovation,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151216001182&ACE_SEARCH=1
"The head of South Korea’s top online game firm Nexon said Tuesday game developers should come up with creative and fun games, warning against the fear of making mistakes. “The fear of making mistakes is the enemy of innovation and it is the enemy of great art,” said Owen Mahoney, chief executive of the Tokyo-headquartered game firm, lashing out at fast-follower strategies widely deployed by Facebook game developers and mobile game developers.“To build great games that capture our imagination, imagination of future generations as art is a proper destination of our game industry,” he added.  He made the remarks at the game company’s annual Nexon Developers Conference, which kicked off in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday.Participants including individual developers and those from small game companies flocked to Nexon’s Pangyo office early Tuesday morning to participate in pre-events including the hands-on experience event for virtual reality headsets Oculus Rift and Gear VR.The 21-year-old game company started the conference with its own developers in 2007 but opened the doors to other developers in 2011, aiming to provide a venue for market players to share ideas and nurture the Korean game industry.The number of presentation and discussion sessions held at the conference, which used to be 33 initially, has now grown to more than 100, and around 20,000 participants including game developers and industry officials are expected to join the three-day conference this year.The subjects dealt in each session range from game design and programming to visual arts and marketing.Some of the speakers at the conference include Michael Antonov, cofounder of virtual reality device maker Oculus, and Chon Kil-nam, a professor emeritus at KAIST.

"From steering wheels with built-in alcohol-detecting breathalyzers to a smart pillow that automatically adjusts itself to help mold a newborn’s head into the right shape, South Korean college students have been recognized for coming up with ideas for several new nanotechnology-based innovations that have yet to hit the market.South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT on Thursday awarded 10 student teams from local universities for winning a competition to present viable ways to apply Korea’s current nanotechnology techniques for practical use in the real world.Last month, the ministry partnered with local startup solutions provider Maru180 to host an inaugural competition to discover and support innovative nanotechnology-based business ideas from local college students.The ministry opened up the details of 10 nanotechnology techniques owned by Korea’s top science and technology research bodies to university students, who were then asked to come up with ideas of products that could be realistically built based on the nanotechnologies.The grand prize was handed to Korea’s leading science and technology research university KAIST that sought to build an “anti-drunk driving steering wheel” by combining 3-D printing with gas sensors based on nanostructured materials.When a person gets in the driver’s seat, the steering wheel equipped with the nano gas sensors would detect the amount of ethanol content in a person’s breath. If alcohol intake is confirmed, the car would give a warning to the driver or automatically shut down the engine from starting. The gold prize went to a team from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology that developed a smart pillow designed to help mold a newborn baby’s head to the right shape. It recognizes the baby’s skull shape based on the amount of pressure it detects, and inflates and deflates based on the needed corrections.Other prize-winning ideas include Sungkyunkwan University’s portable drum set and sticks able to recognize the location and pressure being applied to them, to emulate the intricate sounds of real-life drums. Pohang University of Science and Technology was also recognized for presenting a system that translates pigment information into temperature data using a special camera glass coated with carbon nanotubes, among other invention ideas. The Commercializations Promotion Agency for R&D Outcomes, an organization under the Science Ministry, plans to provide business and legal support, including potential tech transfer opportunities, to the winning teams interested in translating their ideas into commercial products.By Sohn Ji-young ()",Korean students apply new business ideas to nanotechnology,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180105000609&ACE_SEARCH=1
"When an NPU is implemented in a smartphone in addition to the current central processing unit, graphic processing unit and other chips, the device itself can process, analyze and store data produced on the smartphone without the help of a cloud server. The NPU is widely called the brain of smartphones because its architecture looks like that of a human brain, according to scholars. The expert said Samsung is likely to show off some of its NPU capabilities possibly through the debut of the upcoming flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone that is expected to be unveiled on Feb. 25 in Barcelona.“Although the company has been somewhat late in the AI field, it was quite fast in catching up with competitors,” he said. “Still, it is too early to compare the performances of AI chips by Samsung, Apple and Huawei, because the market has just been formed,” he said. “Apple claims that its NPU has reached 600 in giga operations per second, while Huawei says 4 in tera operations per second. Samsung’s is estimated to be similar or slightly higher at the moment.”In computing, GOPS and TOPS are measurements of computer performance that count the rate of floating points of calculations. According to the source, Samsung is particularly dedicated to developing an enhanced NPU for the Galaxy Note 9 smartphone that is scheduled to be launched in September.  Samsung has been ramping up R&D efforts to develop NPUs by collaborating with outside professionals at the country’s top-rate universities.  The tech mogul is working on various AI projects with about 20 professors and nearly 100 researchers at Seoul National University, Pohang University of Science and Technology and Kaist. The company provides about 3 billion won ($2.8 million) for each university a year with a plan for three years, according to academia.  “Samsung seems focused on developing much more efficient and secure chips than existing ones,” said Yoo Hoi-jun, a professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology. “By learning a lesson from the latest ‘Intel CPU gate,’ Samsung would develop AI processors whose architectures are more secure.”  A public relations official at Samsung said, “Development of AI chips is underway led by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology.” The official declined to confirm anything about the progress.

"With Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong freed from jail Monday, the nation’s largest conglomerate is expected to accelerate new businesses that have been on hold in the absence of its de facto leader. “We are very relieved to hear the court decision, although we are still cautious about making any comments as the very final stage remains,” said a source from Samsung.As Lee still has to wait for the final decision by the Supreme Court, he is unlikely to immediately return to the company’s management. The vice chairman is expected to make his way back into management by settling key pending issues. Lee is expected to focus on alleviating concerns about the prospects of the firm’s mainstay, the chip business. Last year, Samsung Electronics posted record earnings driven by the favorable chip industry. However, concerns have been growing due to rising US protectionism and heavy investment from China that could lead to oversupply issues. Samsung has been in gridlock, as the management without the company’s de facto leader faced difficulties in greenlighting trillions of won of investment in next-generation chip technologies.Apart from chips, Lee is also expected to look into merger and acquisition deals or heavy investment in new technologies. Samsung has barely made moves in acquiring new businesses following the purchase of the US infotainment firm Harman in November 2016, while global tech firms, including Google and Apple, continued to make investments in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and self-driving technologies. In 2016, before Lee was arrested, Samsung had acquired six firms that cost more than 100 billion won in value. Samsung is expected to eye new technologies such as self-driving or artificial intelligence technologies, industry watchers said. “Lee’s return will be greatly helpful to Samsung at a time when it needs to find new businesses beyond chips and smartphones. In making strategic partners or making new investment, Lee’s role is important,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor of business administration at KAIST.The vice chairman is also expected to focus on recovering its lost global network. After Lee was arrested, he stepped down as the outside director of Exor, an Italian investment company and owner of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. He also left the board of the Boao Forum, known as Asia’s Davos Forum, early this year. “He is expected to continue the lost global network activities. Samsung is now standing at the crossroads to determine whether it will go independently or make partnerships with global firms, when tech firms, including Google and Amazon, are focusing on platforms connecting everything from devices, appliances to automobiles,” said Park Ju-gun, head of the research firm CEO Score.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","Lee’s return to accelerate inroads into new biz, global network",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180205000840&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Conglomerate’s social enterprise to supply meals during Winter GamesOver a period of 44 days surrounding the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics from Jan. 14 to Feb. 26, some 36,000 meals are to be delivered to members of the staff and cast residing in 33 residences in the vicinity.And the company designated for the job is Happy Dosirak, or Happy Meal Box. The company is one of the social enterprises run by nonprofit fund Happiness Foundation, an affiliate of SK Group, the nation’s second-largest conglomerate in market capitalization. Aside from its participation to the PyeongChang Games, the meal company has been providing public meal services and jobs for the socially disadvantaged since 2006. “SK has been making sustainable efforts to solve social problems by providing meals for the socially vulnerable,” said Kim Yong-kap, chief director of the foundation.“We hope to contribute to the success of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics with our high quality nutritious meals.”As part of efforts to promote Gangwon Province, where PyeongChang is located, the caterer developed a new brand called “Gangwon Banquet,” a series of meals using local ingredients such as pine mushrooms, braised dried pollack and buckwheat, officials said.While lunches and dinners have mostly been provided in conventional Korean-style meal boxes, breakfasts are provided in a lighter form, consisting of sandwiches, porridge, salad and fruit, making it easier for the staff to eat on the go during commuting hours. Partners in the project are Gangwon Social Economy Center, which provides the containers, and local governments in charge of snow removal to facilitate meal delivery.Late last year, SK Group became the first among local conglomerates to establish a private equity fund to invest in social enterprises. The move came in line with Chairman Chey Tae-won’s long-held vision to become more socially aware and active. Corporate outreach to foster social enterprises has long been a core vision for the SK chief.“A higher number of social enterprises will improve our society’s problem solving capacity and promote sustainability,” he wrote in a book in 2014.Chey had earlier called for the need to create over 100,000 social enterprises in the upcoming years to account for about 3 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.For the private equity fund, SK’s Happiness Foundation has so far invested 4 billion won ($3.69 million) into the project, while KEB Hana Bank has invested 1 billion won. IBK Securities, the brokerage affiliated with Industrial Bank of Korea, will operate the program and also discover promising social enterprises.Social enterprises, which seek to improve human society and the environment through business activities, often face challenges in attracting investments, and investors likewise find it difficult to recognize worthwhile businesses. The long-term goal is to create a mutually beneficial matching platform for both sides and eventually to contribute to the nation’s sustainable growth, according to group officials.In 2015, the group kicked off a program to offer financial incentives to social enterprises that manage to achieve their yearly targets of social value. Last year, it gave out some 4.8 billion won in incentives to 93 social enterprises.Reflecting its top chief’s drive for social value and social enterprises, the group is to start a new personnel evaluation system this year to reflect social value achievement in the evaluation criteria of affiliate CEOs.By Bae Hyun-jung ()",Socially aware SK Group joins PyeongChang fever,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180207000883&ACE_SEARCH=1
"At the upcoming Winter Games in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province, human athletes are not going to be the only ones vying for gold in the much-anticipated alpine skiing events.Humanoid robot skiers are going to be hitting the slopes of PyeongChang, as Korea is slated to host the world’s first robot ski tournament on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics. Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Korea Institute for Robot Industry Advancement have organized a ski tournament in which self-operational humanoid robot skiers will compete for the top score in alpine skiing.Eight teams from local universities and tech firms are to compete in the inaugural event. They include the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Kyungpook National University, Kookmin University, Myongji University, Mini Robot Co., Seoul National University of Science and Technology, the Korea Institute of Robot and Convergence and Hanyang University.Each team has prepared a humanoid robot with two legs that wear skis. They are all at least 50 centimeters tall from their feet to the shoulders, and equipped with sensors, batteries and deep learning algorithms that allow them to move on their own.No form of human control is allowed beyond giving the robot the starting cue. The ski bots must hold onto their ski poles at all times. The tournament slope is 70 meters long and 20 meters wide. The robot ski competition will follow the giant slalom alpine skiing discipline, which involves skiing downhill between sets of poles spaced out from each other, according to organizers.Each team will be given three opportunities to ski down the slope, aiming for 100 points each time. The total includes 75 “mission points” awarded for how well it passes through five obstacles, and 25 “record points” for the best overall time record.The robot ski tournament is scheduled to kick off at 10 a.m. on Feb. 11 at the Welli Hill Park ski resort in Hoengseong County near PyeongChang. The event is open for viewing for free to any interested visitor.

"Despite persistent public campaigns by municipal governments to promote clean tap water, South Koreans are known to refrain from drinking it or even using it for cooking. Their heavy reliance on bottled water for consumption shows the lack of trust in water storage and safety mechanisms here.One Seoul-based startup believes that could change, with technology that will enable real-time waterborne bacteria monitoring -- a laser sensor that can be attached inside water pipes to detect the existence of even tiny amounts of impurities.“Our goal is to ensure the safety of water and food, which form the very essence of life,” said Kim Young-dug, co-founder and CEO of The Wave Talk, a Korean sensor technology startup. The firm is looking to introduce a new and improved bacteria detection method with applications across water safety, food inspection and even antibiotics diagnosis.The Wave Talk was co-founded by Kim and optical physics expert Park Yong-keun, both serial entrepreneurs and graduates of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.On the water safety front, the startup has developed a laser-based sensor that is able to catch impurities inside water pipe systems in real time, and with sensitivity higher than existing methods. The laser sensor works by shining a laser beam through the water. When the light hits the water, it will travel in a certain pathway. If it runs into impurities on the way, such as bacteria, the light’s pathway changes. And this change is detected by the sensor through algorithms.The Wave Talk’s device is able to find impurities that are too small to be noticed by conventional laser sensors. For instance, it is much harder to detect a single bacterium, than say 1,000 bacteria, through a laser scan because the light pathway change prompted by the bacteria is too minimal.The Wave Talk’s laser sensor has overcome this issue by amplifying the unique refraction signal created by a subject, however small. This allows even the smallest particle to be detected and accounted for.The technology can be applied to monitor tap water systems, as well as to ensure that liquids requiring absolute purity, such as bottled water or intravenous fluid, remain pollutant-free during production. The system can even be engineered to automatically shut off or deter the water flow, in case impurities are detected.As of now, The Wave Talk has already sold its sensor system to clients, including a local bottled water maker and Coway which rents out purified water dispensers to households.But its bigger business interests lie in monitoring tap water pipes. The startup has teamed up with Korea’s Nongshim Engineering and IBM Korea to apply its sensor to commercial tap water systems in Korea. The consortium is pursuing a joint project on this front with the Ministry of Environment and Korea Water Resources Corp., or K-Water.After Korea, the firm wants to bring its sensor system to global markets. It plans to get its sensor technology system officially certified by K-Water, after which it can pitch the product to water authorities in other countries such as the US, Japan and China.In addition to real-time waterborne bacteria sensing, The Wave Talk wants to apply its laser sensor technology to improve efficiency in other areas such as food inspection and antibiotics diagnosis.Right now, fresh foods sold on the market, such as raw chicken meat, require a bacteria test based on “culturing.” The process involves taking a sample of chicken meat and juicing it. In the juice, you place food for the bacteria to feed on and wait for them to multiply. After 48 hours, you count the colonies of bacteria in the dish. Under food safety regulations, the amount of bacteria per square milliliter has to remain below a specific figure to pass.The Wave Talk believes it can replace this 48-hour culturing process with its laser scanner that is able to obtain the same information in just three hours, saving time and costs.“Bacteria doubles in number every 30 minutes. Though it cannot be observed by the naked eye, the growth happens at a constant interval, Kim said. “Our goal is to observe the data for just three hours and predict how many bacteria will be present in 48 hours.”The startup eyes similar efficiencies in the antibiotic prescription process. When a person has an unknown bacterial infection, physicians conduct tests to find the right type and dosage of an antibiotic that will kill the bacteria.The current procedure involves taking a sample of blood from the infected person and multiplying the bacteria. Then, physicians spray the bacteria with different types of antibiotics lined up in varying dosages, and wait. If the bacteria don’t grow, the antibiotic is working. On top of finding the effective antibiotic, the physicians have to find the “minimal inhibitory concentration,” to determine the right dosage to be used on the human patient. The current procedure, which also uses a laser sensor, takes somewhere between 10 to 15 hours to complete, as it has to wait for the bacteria to multiply to a point where they can be detected.However, The Wave Talk’s laser sensor offers 10,000 times greater sensitivity, and can therefore pick up the presence of bacteria without having to wait for them to form a colony. During a joint experiment with Chonbuk National University Hospital, the startup was able to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration in just under 45 minutes, Kim said.The firm’s long-term goal is to be able to determine not only the presence of bacteria, but also classifying its type. Kim said the firm is aiming to identify the 12 types of bacteria most harmful to humans, such as salmonella and anthrax.“The likelihood of survival from a bacterial infection drops by the hour. By diagnosing a given bacteria quicker, we can help find the right antibiotic for the infection faster, saving lives,” said the CEO.The Wave Talk is currently backed by KAIST as well as a number of venture capital firms including Naver’s D2Startup Factory, Estech Pharma and Bluepoint Partners, among others. It is currently wrapping up its Series A funding round.

"The Daejeon Creative Economy Innovation Center, jointly established by SK Group and the South Korean government in a bid to nurture local start-ups, officially welcomed a new batch of venture firms to its facilities on Tuesday.A total of 10 start-ups specializing in a diverse spectrum of businesses -- including the Internet of Things technology, health care, semiconductors, energy, solutions and fintech -- are set to receive tailored business mentorship and support at the center for the next 10 months. “These new venture firms are expected to reap early success, given their high levels of technology and readiness for commercialization,” said Lim Jong-tae, director of the Daejeon center. “We will capitalize on our previous experience, and support from Daejeon City, the Korean government and SK Group to propel the country’s drive to build a creative economy,” he said.SK Group plans to nurture the new firms and boost their existing strengths by connecting each company with related experts from its core affiliates, since most of the focus areas of the start-ups overlap with SK’s ongoing businesses.The conglomerate will regularly review ongoing progress being made by the new firms, as well as provide them with any necessary industry data and support, including opportunities to partner with investors from China.In a bid to create synergy with the nation’s 17 regional creative economy innovation centers focused on varying industries, SK has also built up a system to combine the centers’ strengths to boost the Daejeon-based start-ups.Standard Energy, a start-up which possesses upgraded battery storage technology, is set to network with the carbon fiber-focused Jeongbuk Creative Economy Center led by Hyosung Group to improve its technology. Active Wi-Fi-camera developer THES, part of the first group of start-ups incubated at the Daejeon Center, is currently working with the Busan Creative Economy Center led by retail giant Lotte Group to commercialize its products.Located at KAIST, one of Korea’s most prestigious universities focused on science and technology research and development, the Daejeon center opened its doors in October 2014 aiming to help information and communications technology-focused start-ups commercialize their technology and expand their businesses globally.The center’s first set of venture firms, selected last year, have managed to attract more than 3.20 billion won ($2.7 million) in investments and record around 1.96 billion won in sales, a significant improvement from just 320 million won in sales posted prior to entering the center, according to SK Group.By Sohn Ji-young ()",SK Daejeon innovation center greets new start-ups,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150901001024&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Although K-pop has garnered attention worldwide especially across Asia, Korean pop songs still lack international appeal.In order to further boost K-pop globally, Korean producers and artists should try mixing different genres such as hip pop and jazz whose sounds are appealing in other parts of the world, a prominent U.S. music producer and artist said.“Maybe, it could combine musical elements around the world. I have used R&B, hip pop, Bollywood sounds and Asian sounds -- anything that triggered a somewhat different culture,” said Nate “Danja” Hills at a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday.“I think that is what it is. We have to make it worldly. Maybe that is how to get the K-pop sound worldwide.”Hills, a record producer and artist who has worked with singers including Britney Spears, Whitney Houston and Justin Timberlake, was invited as one of the keynote speakers for “The Future of Music Production” at the 4th Seoul International Music Fair 2015, or MU:CON, at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul.Over the next two days, global and local musicians, artists and producers will gather not only for business exchanges but also find ways to use technology and innovate to attract a greater number of music audiences in emerging markets such as China and Indonesia.Under the theme of “Key to the Global Music Gate,” MU:CON 2015 will hold forums on music licensing, digital music markets and emerging technologies such as virtual reality and holograms.“We aim to create a new culture through this conference by tearing down boundaries through music,” said Song Sung-gak, president and CEO of the Korea Creative Content Agency, the host of MU:CON 2015.Entertainment companies such as CJ E&M and SM Entertainment, and professors from KAIST and Catholic Kwandong University will hold forums and seminars. MU:CON will showcase performances of some 50 artists, including alternative bands Hyukoh and Kiha & The Faces, and K-pop groups B1A4 and GFriend.Hills said old, new, big or small music artists and producers should embrace new technologies, which can help not only to create music cost-effectively, but also make quality sounds at home equivalent to those made in large studios with special equipment.Technology has enabled people to “cut a lot of corners,” and learn tools and software programs on their own to create quality music on the Internet via various streaming platforms.“I can produce quality sound in front of you guys right now, and mix and master in 15 minutes. Technology has allowed us to do it, and put everyone on the same playing field -- big or small are competing at the same level,” he said.“It can be difficult for those really talented to shine through because untalented people can learn technology to create music.”Despite technology enabling music production and accessibility, Hills said musicians should ultimately seek to create expression, and producers should help artists translate musical expression for global audiences.“Music is expression. They make music differently in London, U.S. or in Asia. I can’t say one is better than other. I heard great music in Asia, stupid in America. There is no right or wrong, or better or worse. It is ultimately artists’ expression,” Hills said.“Producers are the gateway. I like to translate what artists bring. My job is to translate music internationally.”By Park Hyong-ki ()",‘K-pop should try mixing genres for global appeal’: US producer,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151006000764&ACE_SEARCH=1
"President Moon Jae-in’s nuclear phaseout policy has resurfaced as a bone of contention, triggered by ruling Democratic Party Rep. Song Young-gil’s remarks that the construction of Shin Hanwool 3 and 4 should be resumed.As the first ruling party politician to raise a dissenting voice against the administration’s push for a nuclear phaseout, Song instantly drew criticism from a fellow party member. But two opposition parties praised Song’s remarks and called them “brave.” Questions over whether South Korea is capable of producing sufficient renewable energy coupled with the fact that the likely candidates to head the state-run Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute favor the phaseout are widely expected to further exacerbate the political wrangling, with the main opposition parties stepping up pressure on the government to retain nuclear energy.“The collapse of the supply chain for nuclear reactor equipment is becoming a reality due to the government’s decision to stop construction of new nuclear power plants. For the export and safe operations of nuclear reactors, equipment should be supplied consistently,” Song said last Friday at an event hosted by the country’s nuclear energy industry.“Though old nuclear reactors and power generators should be suspended, the government needs to consider resuming the construction of Shin Hanwool 3 and 4,” he said, though he also expressed agreement with Moon’s general road map for phasing out nuclear power.Song also emphasized the economic value of nuclear reactor exports. An export of a reactor is worth about $5 billion, equivalent to the export of 250,000 midsize cars or 5 million smartphones.On the campaign trail, Moon vowed to bring up renewable energy to 20 percent of total energy sources by 2030 from the current 7 percent.As part of the plan, the government in 2017 dropped plans to construct six nuclear reactors that the Trade Ministry had approved in February that year, including Shin Hanwool 3 and 4. The government also shut down Wolseong 1 last summer despite fierce opposition from opposition parties and industry players.Resembling Taiwan’s phaseout road map, which that country abandoned in late 2017 due to a massive electricity shortage, the Moon government’s plan calls for 10 of the current 23 nuclear reactors to be idled by 2029. Criticizing Song, Rep. Woo Won-sik of the Democratic Party, who also heads the party’s special committee on energy transition, said on social media, “It is a shame. The argument to return to nuclear reactors citing problematic old power plants is completely inconsiderate of the current trend.”Woo defended the Moon administration’s nuclear phaseout as a 60-year plan that involves the shutdown of old reactors.The main opposition Korea Liberty Party, which is collecting online signatures against Moon’s nuclear phaseout, lauded Song’s remarks, urging the government to immediately begin construction of Shin Hanwool 3 and 4 and to scrap policies to phase out nuclear power. “The ruling party has finally begun to notice the problem with the nuclear phaseout. The policy destroys Korea’s power plant ecosystem and future profit generator,” said Na Kyung-won, the ruling party floor leader, during Monday’s emergency committee meeting.Echoing Na, minor opposition Bareunmirae Party floor leader Kim Kwan-young said, “In the midst of Cheong Wa Dae’s unilateral push for a nuclear phaseout policy, it was a brave confession.”“Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party must review overall energy policies and pay attention to Song’s confession ... going back on the construction of Shin Hanwool 3 and 4 is a move that will tarnish the credibility of government-led policies.”Amid the deepening conflict, some industry experts are voicing the need for Korea to slow down the speed of the nuclear phaseout, citing the country’s lack of wind, hydro and solar power to meet the electricity demand.“It is logical for (Korea) to cut its goal by more than half for 2040,” said Jeong Yong-hoon, a professor at KAIST’s Department of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering.“The government argues that renewable energy should make up 40 percent of energy sources by 2040 in line with the global outlook. But as we are not expanding hydroelectric power, a 20 percent ratio would be plenty,” Jung added.Evidence suggests that Korea’s two main target sources of renewable energy -- solar and wind power -- are incapable of producing sufficient energy to meet demand. Last August, at the peak of summer, the operating ratio of wind power remained low at 13 percent because “there’s not a lot of wind in the summer,” said state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation’s central load dispatch center, adding that the usage rate of solar plants was 44 percent. The appointment of the director of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute next month looks set to intensify the conflict, with industry insiders anticipating that out of the 16 candidates, one of the three pro-nuclear phaseout candidates is likely to take office.Former head of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission Kang Jung-min and professor Park Jong-un of Dongguk University’s department of nuclear energy system engineering sought to stop the construction of the Shin Kori-5 and Shin Kori-6 reactors in 2017, while former Ministry of Education and Science Technology’s nuclear safety director Moon Byeong-ryong served as an adviser to Science and ICT First Vice Minister Mun Mi-ock, then Cheong Wa Dae’s science and technology aide, who participated in the drawing up of the administration’s nuclear phaseout policy.

"Prosecutors in South Korea have decided not to indict commercial bank KEB Hana Bank for offering preferential loans to Chung Yoo-ra, according to a news report Monday.Chung, 22, is a daughter of Choi Soon-sil, ex-president Park Geun-hye’s longtime confidante who was sentenced to 20 years behind bars in February for a corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of Park last March. KEB Hana Bank issued a standby letter of credit worth 386,600 euro ($476,200) to Chung in 2014, when she was 19. Chung put up a 230,000 square-meter piece of land in Gangwon Province as collateral in 2015. Chung was able to take out 385,000 euro of loans in the bank’s branch in Germany, while not leaving a trace of foreign currency transactions. KEB Hana Bank regarded Chung as a non-resident of Korea in issuing the standby credit. But the bank was alleged to have neglected a duty when issuing the document, as it exempted Chung from submitting requirements such as proof of obtaining offshore real estate loans.The act led to suspicions that KEB Hana Bank had violated the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. Prosecutors on Sunday, however, said KEB Hana Bank “did not fail in its duty,” as a document by the Bank of Korea and a copy of the document from Chung‘s office in Germany could be seen as valid to prove that Chung was a non-resident.“It is hard to say KEB Hana Bank failed to have abided by a mandate to verify Chung‘s status,” a source from prosecutors’ office told a local daily Money Today. This came a few days after the Financial Supervisory Service, financial watchdog, cleared KEB Hana Bank of suspicions of failure in its duty in approving loans worth a combined 2.2 billion won ($2 million) to i-KAIST. i-Kaist is a startup devoted to education consulting business, but its founder is behind bars on charges of colluding to the Park administration. Meanwhile, the FSS on Monday embarked on a probe on whether Kim Jung-tai, chairman of the bank‘s parent company Hana Financial Group, had meddled in a process of promoting a certain employee. Kim is currently serving a third three-year term since January 2018.(consnow@heraldcorp.com)",Prosecutors drop case against KEB Hana Bank on allegedly favoring Chung Yoo-ra: report,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180305000751&ACE_SEARCH=1
"A team of South Korean researchers developed an “OLED patch” that can be attached to the skin to help wounds heal using an organic light-emitting diode source aimed at damaged areas.The technology was developed by a group of researchers led by KAIST’s Jeon Yong-min and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital’s Choi Hye-ryung. The finding were published in the academic journal Advanced Material Technologies on March 8. The OLED patch has been designed as an easy, portable tool for delivering a technique called photobiomodulation. PBM is a form of light therapy that uses lasers or light-emitting diodes to improve tissue repair as well as reduce pain and inflammation.PBM has long been considered a safe and noninvasive method of instigating tissue regeneration. Yet, conventional PBM devices using pointed light sources, such as light-emitting diodes and lasers have key shortcomings, including low flexibility, heavy weight and uneven applications. Overcoming such disadvantages, the Korean research team developed a wearable PBM patch using a “flexible red-wavelength OLED surface light source, which can be attached to the human body,” according to the research paper.The OLED patch is palm-sized, lightweight, flexible and durable. It weighs 0.82 grams and has a thickness of just 676 micrometers. The patch can operate for more than 300 hours, and is able to bend along a curve with a 20 millimeter radius. Its temperature also remains below 40 degrees Celsius at all times, removing risks of a first-degree burn.  Given the design, the light therapy patch can be worn on the skin comfortably, allowing patients to receive constant treatment daily without much discomfort, according to developers. The Korean research team has proven through experiments that the OLED patches can help heal wounds by stimulating the proliferation and migration of fibroblast, a type of dermal cells that play a key role in the wound healing process.The OLED patch was shown to increase fibroblast proliferation by 58 percent, and fibroblast migration by 46 percent, proving its effectiveness in tissue regeneration, according to the team. “Once commercialized, our patch will enable patients to receive light therapy conveniently,” said the paper’s lead author Jeon via the National Research Foundation of Korea.“By controlling the amount of the emitted light, we can also extend the product’s use to include not just skin regeneration, but also treating conditions like skin cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and depression.”This research was sponsored by a basic research support program led by Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT. By Sohn Ji-young ()",Korean researchers develop ‘OLED patch’ that heals wounds using light,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180319000794&ACE_SEARCH=1
"The ministry said the Svalbard satellite station located in the Arctic Circle established initial contact followed by signals being received by KAIST in South Korea about six hours and 30 minutes after the launch, the ministry said.The ministry said all of the satellite's solar panels have been deployed properly, allowing it to generate power.""The successful launch of the Next Sat-1 was possible not only due to endless efforts and passion of the KAIST researchers but also the help of researchers from all fields,"" Choi Won-ho, a ministry official, told reporters in Seoul.Starting February, the satellite will measure space radiation and observe infrared light from the stars for two years, following a three-month period of preparations, officials said.The launch was first delayed when American rocket company SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, extended an inspection of its two-stage rocket, the Falcon 9. The launch was further pushed back multiple times due to various weather conditions.It is a groundbreaking launch for SpaceX in numerous ways as not only is this the first time the company has reused the rocket for a third time but it is the biggest batch of satellites that has ever taken off on a single launch from US soil.The Falcon 9 safely reentered the atmosphere and landed after about eight minutes of flight.Until now, practically all orbital rockets were disposable, meaning the rockets were discarded after launch. SpaceX has been reused twice.Experts forecast the launch would open the new horizons for spaceflight, with SpaceX hoping that the Falcon 9 rocket would be able make numerous trips into space, thus reducing costs.The rocket's payload included 15 microsatellites and 49 CubeSats from both commercial and government entities, including 25 from international organizations.At present, South Korea operates four satellites for weather and Earth observation.

"KAIST, South Korea’s top science and technology university, on Friday decided to delay its decision on dismissing its incumbent President Shin Sung-chul, who has been accused by the government of mishandling public funds during his previous post at another university. KAIST’s board said it will reconsider the dismissal of the president at the next board meeting, given the gravity of the issue and continued dispute over the accusations by the Ministry of Science and ICT.The ministry alleges that Shin mishandled public funds while serving as the president of the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology from 2011 to 2017, before joining KAIST.The allegations center on DGIST’s payments to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, as part of a deal in which scientists at Korean universities were given access to one of LBNL’s imaging equipment.The Science Ministry asserts that the payments -- 2.2 billion won ($1.9 million) -- were not a part of a 2012 agreement between DGIST and LBNL and were transferred in a separate arrangement, violating regulations. The ministry also alleges that some of the money was paid to an individual who was a former student of Shin’s, in what could amount to embezzlement. It has referred the case to the prosecution and asked KAIST to dismiss Shin.Shin has denied the accusations, and the science community has acted in support of Shin. On Monday, the LBNL sent a letter to the ministry explaining that the agreement was legally executed. KAIST’s physics department, where Shin worked from 1989 to 2011, has also drawn up a petition claiming that moves to dismiss the president lack due process as they are based on unproven accusations and an ongoing investigation that has yet to conclude. Some researchers view the KAIST case as a part of a political purge against public science institutions by the Moon Jae-in administration. Shin assumed his post under former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and imprisoned for corruption, abuse of power and embezzlement.

"An industrial design student from Costa Rica who developed a kimchi timer during her time at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology is set to receive her master’s degree on Friday. Maria Jose Reyes Castro, 25, conducted a study to develop the device, which uses a mobile app and a smart sensor to check the pH level of kimchi as it’s fermenting. With the app, users input the desired levels of fermentation and salinity. The app then forecasts the date and time when the kimchi can be expected to be ready. Though the timer is optimized for cabbage kimchi, it can be used to check other types of kimchi too. After coming to South Korea in 2012, Castro met foreign students from other Asian and European nations who complained of difficulty making kimchi. That inspired her to learn about the process by watching recipe videos on YouTube and seeking advice from kimchi experts to gain a better understanding of Korea’s traditional culinary culture. “Practical studies that can add convenience to daily life is as important as high technologies that changes the world,” Castro said. “Using expert knowledge, I would like to focus on science that makes various products that people can use in daily life.” Biodesign professor Daniel Saakes from the Netherlands was her academic adviser for the study. In 2017, Saakes invented a device to help users make dumplings in various shapes. Now in his seventh year in Korea, the professor shared his experience of Korean culinary culture when working with Castro.“Adding to the design value and the practicality of the study, it holds great meaning as a student from Costa Rica conducted a study related to kimchi under the direction of a professor from the Netherlands,” said professor Nam Taek-jin, head of the university’s department of industrial design.

"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and United Arab Emirates’ Khalifa University of Science and Technology opened the KAIST-KU Joint Research Center in Abu Dhabi, as part of their efforts to enhance cooperation in the wake of “Industry 4.0,” KAIST said Tuesday. The two universities plan to actively pursue joint research projects in sectors such as smart health care and smart transportation platforms to better prepare for the challenges of the era of artificial intelligence.“We plan to solidify our cooperation in terms of education and research in nuclear and energy sectors,” said Yim Man-Sung, dean of the KUSTAR-KAIST Institute of Education, at the opening ceremony of the research center. “We will play a bridge role in achieving sustainable development of Korea and the UAE by strengthening cooperation in the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ to foster future growth engines.”KAIST President Shin Sung-chul and Sarah al-Amiri, minister of state for advanced sciences in the UAE cabinet, agreed to expand cooperation in the fourth industrial revolution at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in February last year. A month later, the two universities signed a memorandum of understanding on industrial technology development.KAIST and KU have carried out some 200 joint projects across various fields, including nuclear energy and electrical and mechanical engineering since 2011. KAIST assisted KU in developing a course on nuclear engineering after a Korean group won a landmark deal to build and operate four nuclear reactors in the UAE.

"DAEJEON -- A small graduate school has surprised academia. Located a 20-minute drive away from the Government Complex Sejong and two hours from Seoul, it has a relatively short foundation history of 15 years.The school is the University of Science & Technology in northern Daejeon, with which ordinary Koreans may not be familiar. In the World University Rankings 2018-19 by the Center for World University Rankings, UST ranked 183rd in the world and second in South Korea, above Georgetown University of the US (the world’s 289th) and KAIST (the world’s 295th and Korea’s sixth).“I believe our high standing could be attributable to a high score in objective research performance,” UST President Moon Kil-choo told The Korea Herald. He did not hesitate to say with confidence that the result does not coincide with school reputation or assessment that reflects the undergraduate sector, which is irrelevant to the graduate school. As of Feb. 24, 2019, UST has produced 707 graduates with doctorates and 1,528 with master’s degrees, including foreign students from more than 40 countries.The campus in the metropolitan city, where Moon’s office is located, has less than five buildings. The school dispatches students to 32 affiliated campuses across the nation. These campuses are government-funded high-end technology research institutes with an average history of establishment of about 50 years.“(As a dual system,) students both study and work (doing research) for eight hours a day at the institutes nationwide,” Moon said.The president picked working and studying concurrently as a merit of the graduate school. “As far as I’m concerned, the school is no more a place for teaching. Unlike past decades, the school is now a place to learn from others.” He likened the UST curriculum to US schools that dispatch students to private enterprises like Google LLC or Apple Inc. for a certain period of work, adding, “We still lag behind the US case, though.”Data showed that UST is gaining attention particularly among foreign applicants, who have made up around 30 percent of inbound students over the past few years. As of February this year, the number of foreigners at the school came to 405 out of the total 1,347 students. While students from Southeast Asia and China topped the list in the early stage of establishment, these days the number of applicants from Eastern Europe and Africa has grown sharply. There were also some students from the US and South America.“Future society is a connected society. Thus, some people don’t use the term globalization anymore,” Moon said. “We will continue to seek more diversity in nationalities, like pushing for attracting students from Europe.”Asked the reason why foreign students choose South Korea, Moon said more and more foreign students are acknowledging the nation’s economic scale and enthusiasm for education. “While foreigners worldwide also hope to study in the US, some of them select between schools in Korea and Japan as a niche.” According to the school’s administration center, a student from the Middle East had picked studying in Korea instead of France or Russia for a nuclear energy major, citing Korea’s status as one of the world’s five major powerhouses in the nuclear power sector and the UST’s distinctive research and study system.The 32 institutes affiliated with UST allocate mid- and long-term assignments to both foreign and local students.“As the assignments are futuristic items, selected by the government, students have the benefit of engaging in crucial, prospective projects (during their four semesters). Thus (our education) holds potential,” said Moon. Among the campuses are the National Fusion Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science & Technology, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Korea Astronomy & Space Science Institute, Korea Aerospace Research Institute, Korea Polar Research Institute, Korea Food Research Institute and Agency for Defense Development.There are campuses in four big cities -- Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon and Busan -- and four provinces -- Gyeonggi, South Chungcheong, North Jeolla and South Gyeongsang. The majors offered are broadly classified into six fields: natural science; information technology; bio technology; nano technology; environmental technology; and space technology.Furthermore, the graduate school’s growth potential has also been proven domestically. In a 2018 assessment by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation, UST ranked No. 1 in thesis performance in the areas of 3D printing and the internet of things among local universities with graduate schools.Since his inauguration in January 2016, Moon’s philosophy has been that “schools are charged with a mission to make up-front investments in outstanding students, who can contribute to society 10 years later.”In addition to their studies at campuses, UST students are required to take classes on the history of science and big data at the school’s headquarters.“We would see the future through history as people say, and the tool for the use of big data must be artificial intelligence. These two are required subjects here irrespective of their majors, such as bio, construction and aeronautic engineering,” said Moon.Moon hopes to attract the sons and daughters of foreigners working at Korean units of global enterprises. “Foreign branch executives and employees here still don’t know about UST, so we are vitalizing school promotion,” he said.Noting that Ivy League schools are also active in public relations, he stressed that everyone admitted to UST will be able to be engage in research with little financial burden on the back of the support of state-initiated scholarship programs.“Our students pay their tuition fees and living expenses with their earnings from working (sort of on-the-spot research) apart from studying.”UST has been likened to “a comet” in the traditional academic field. Moon describes the school as an Apache helicopter -- small with strong, expeditious power.Another noteworthy aspect of the school is its high proportion of women among students at 35 percent compared to science and engineering-oriented colleges and graduate schools in the nation.UST President Moon was recently named co-chair of the Special Commission on Fine Dust Pollution -- also known as the Clean Air Committee -- along with Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.Moon holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering in the areas of particle technology and air pollution. He had worked as director of the Global Environmental Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. He had also taken the post of president at the International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations.Moon highlighted a possible solution in dealing with air pollution here: attaching “tags” on fine dust from China as there are materials that are only generated in the neighboring country. These tags could then be used as evidence in possible disputes with China, he said.Moon, however, claimed that fine dust could also come from other regions such as Mongol, North Korea and Japan - which is outside of South Korea - aside from China.He also said that “all of us might simultaneously be assailants and victims of fine dust. So, reduction efforts on the basis of scientific grounds are important.” He pointed out that Korea’s climate pattern has changed since 2015. “Wind has weakened in Seoul over the past few years. This means fine dust could have held more strength in recent years in the wake of climate change, and may cause mortality for those suffering from a chronic disease.”This spring might be one the most sensitive, busiest seasons out of his career. On Feb. 15, Moon and Prime Minister Lee began a series of meetings to map out countermeasures against fine dust at the Government Complex Seoul.He also appeared busy in his office in Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, in preparing for a commencement address for the graduation ceremony, scheduled for the next day of the interview.Outside his office was bustling with preparing for the Feb. 21 ceremony, when the outgoing students were destined to gather in the headquarters after finishing their assignments nationwide.2019- Chairperson, Clean Air Committee2016- President, University of Science and Technology2013-16 President, International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations2013-14 Member, Presidential Advisory Council on Science & Technology2010-13 President, Korea Institute of Science and Technology1984 Doctorate of mechanical engineering (particle technology, air pollution) at University of MinnesotaBy Kim Yon-se ()",[Herald Interview] Small-but-nationwide graduate school appeals to foreigners,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190224000062&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Checking for signs of cancer has long been confined to the domain of hospitals, where complex examinations are conducted. It could be an MRI, a CT scan, a lengthy blood test or a biopsy that requires harvesting a sample of tissue from the body for further examination at a lab.But what if similar cancer diagnostics procedures could be achieved in the comfort of your home? This could be made possible by using a portable blood testing device developed by South Korean health care technology startup BBB.Founded in 2014, Seoul-based BBB has developed a sensor-equipped portable device that examines a droplet of blood to detect cancer signals. The product, named MarkB, is slated to hit the Korean market by the end of this year.Using the device is easy. You simply prick your fingertip with a needle and dab the blood onto the one-use testing strip. Just 30 microliters of blood -- which you get by slightly squeezing the punctured area -- is enough. The data generated is logged and kept by your doctor for monitoring.According to BBB founder and CEO Choi Jae-kyu, the firm has positioned the product as a prognosis device. It is intended for use by post-surgery cancer patients required to undergo routine checkups every three to six months. Though patients would still have to go to the hospital for imaging-based examinations, they could conduct blood tests in the convenience of their homes.After accumulating positive use cases, BBB hopes to reposition MarkB as an at-home cancer prevention tool for use by anyone, the 38-year-old CEO and serial entrepreneur said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. “With good references, we want to be able to position the device as a cancer prevention tool for use by any interested individual,” said Choi, a KAIST graduate with a background in electric engineering as well bio and brain engineering. So how does it work? MarkB rests on two fundamental technologies. One is the ability to completely separate out plasma -- the part of the blood containing proteins -- from the blood. The other is using electromagnetic waves to separate out selected cancer cell-derived proteins, and detecting their density. Identifying the density of these proteins in the blood allows doctors to determine whether cancer cells are growing or shrinking inside a patient’s body. And this is what BBB’s device can do precisely, according to Choi.“Our device automatically separates out the plasma and captures just the desired proteins. And all of this is controlled via our biosensor. The key is that we’ve managed to miniaturize and automate procedures previously carried out by large, heavy equipment, without compromising accuracy,” Choi said. For now, MarkB can check for five most common cancers -- colorectal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, uterine and ovarian cancer as well as cancer affecting digestive organs such as the pancreas and gallbladder. The firm hopes to expand the device’s diagnostic scope in the future.Currently, the Korean health-tech startup is working on clinical trials for its device in partnership with Seoul University Bundang Hospital, with aims to score approval by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. But the startup’s eventual goal is to tap into global markets. BBB is currently preparing documents and clinical trial data to get MarkB approved by medical device regulators in the US and Europe.With the solid health care data collected by its diagnostics devices, BBB envisions the creation of a personalized health care platform based on which companies could help predict diseases and take preventive action if needed.As one of a handful of health technology startups operating and paving the way for a new market in Korea, BBB believes it has a duty to pave the direction of the local regulatory system to regulate newly developed medical devices that do not have a precedent.“A lot of startups in this sector tend to complain that they can’t develop new products because regulations have yet to exist. But I think the lead should be taken by the industry, and followed-up on by regulatory agencies,” the BBB CEO said.“You first need a product, before regulations can be drawn up. When companies present devices that offer acceptable performance and usability, the regulations will naturally follow.”BBB is already ahead in this aspect, as it has brought to market another blood testing device with success. Elemark, which measures blood glucose levels, was approved last year for use by diabetes patients.Led by deals related to Elemark, BBB logged around 6.1 billion won ($5.71 million) in revenue last year. This year, it expects to achieve around 8 billion won in revenue, and see a major hike in earnings once MarkB sales take off, Choi said.So far, BBB has secured around 5.5 billion won in Series A funding from various venture capital firms including Posco Venture Capital and Mirae Asset Capital. It plans to raise further capital for research and development this year.By Sohn Ji-young ()",[Health-tech Korea] Diagnosing cancer with a drop of blood,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180409000677&ACE_SEARCH=1
"As Artificial Intelligence is rippling through every corner of our lives, ethical challenges and philosophical issues are also coming our way. The most important question is: what is the outer limit of the AI technology? Recent incidents involving AI in the military sector offer some silhouette of a possible answer.Now, AI is making an inroad into the defense industry. Autonomous weapons are becoming a reality. Taken to its technical extreme, it will not be too long before we see fully autonomous warfare machines with self-analysis and self-decision capabilities appear in future battle fields. The pace and consequences, however, raise a voice of concern. Unlike other areas of AI application, the military’s use of it is in a fundamentally different league because it may well be lethal: it is feared that these “deploy and forget” types of machines can identify a target and initiate an attack on its own. Existing regulation of combat and law of war may not cover the entire spectrum of these new non-human combatants. It is this sentiment that underlies foreign academics’ concern over the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology’s recent plan to participate in a joint research program with a private corporation to develop, possibly, autonomous weapons. The concern was pointed at the development of autonomous weapons “lacking meaningful human control.” To paraphrase: human beings must have a final say in the decision making process of AI machines. Faced with a foreign scholars’ threat of a boycott of cooperative activities, KAIST now officially denies any intention of conducting such research and the case seems to be closed. Take another example. It has been several years since Korea deployed sentry robots or equipment along the DMZ. In response to similar concerns from foreign watchers, assurances have been given over the years that the machines remain under soldiers’ control at all times.Consider yet another one. Some of Google’s employees sent a letter in early April to its management taking issue with the company’s cooperation with the Department of Defense to enhance video imagery that may facilitate targeting process of drones. The concern expressed by the employees is largely similar. Both Google and the Pentagon have stated that the research would not lead to autonomous weapons that initiate an attack without human control. Here again, the key term was “human control.”This question is also related to who should be held responsible for consequences from activities of autonomous lethal machines. By having human beings in the loop, it can be ensured that final responsibility still lies in the person in charge - a strong deterrence to any misuse or abuse of new machines.AI is taking over dangerous and difficult tasks from us. It is and will be replacing human beings in many areas and activities. What is not clear yet is who and how to supervise these autonomous machines. Recent incidents represent a compelling consensus at least in the field of military operation: regardless of the technological development or feasibility, it is critical to put AI under the control of human beings and to ensure that a final decision is only to be made by human beings. This logic may also apply to other areas where AI encounters core societal values or weighs critical ethical questions. In other words, there are tasks where human oversight can never be dispensed with. The rise of AI and the advent of autonomous machines throw out complex legal and philosophical questions. AI in the military application brings these questions to the fore. A UN conference on this very topic is being held this week in Geneva under the auspice of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Perhaps the discussions there may lead to an adoption of legal norms that can guide the development and utilization of these autonomous lethal weapons in the future.

"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Times Higher Education are jointly holding a three-day conference in South Korea on the changing roles of universities in the era of the “fourth industrial revolution,” KAIST said Monday.The 2019 KAIST-THE Innovation & Impact summit is being held from Tuesday to Thursday at KAIST’s main campus in Daejeon, bringing together some 300 leaders from 25 countries in the fields of education, industry and politics. THE University Impact Rankings, a new ranking of universities’ impact on society, will be exclusively disclosed during a session Wednesday and published globally Thursday. Phil Baty, chief knowledge officer at THE, said that universities’ social and economic impact on the world have been “underappreciated” in league tables, and THE wanted to take into account the “great things” universities do to make the world a better place.It is the first time that THE, which has published the World University Rankings since 2004, has ranked universities in terms of social and economic impact -- the first ranking to measure universities’ success in delivering the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The ranking includes metrics based on 11 of the 17 SDGs, according to THE. This year, more than 500 institutions from 75 countries across six continents submitted data for the new ranking, it said. During the summit, participants will discuss four topics -- educational innovation, transfer of knowledge and entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence and culture, and the Trip Helix of Innovation -- and draw up institutions’ policy directions in Industry 4.0.Former and incumbent presidents of some of the world’s most prestigious universities and business leaders will share their experiences, insights and development strategies through presentations during the summit.Among them is Lino Guzzella, former president of ETH Zurich, who is set to give a speech Wednesday on “Higher Education -- Coping with the Knowledge Inflation and Preparing for Success.”Guzzella is expected to underscore the importance of critical thinking, creativity, imagination and entrepreneurship in an era when information is abundant amid the rise of artificial intelligence, and educational methods of rote learning are not as competitive and effective as before. Bin Yang, vice president and provost at Tsinghua University, is also set to give a speech titled “Reflection and Practice of Higher Education in an Era of Innovation” on Wednesday. Tsinghua University stole the top spot from National University of Singapore in the Times Higher Education Asia-Pacific ranking in 2019. Yang is expected to talk about how universities should use young talent and the importance of international cooperation in a hyper-interconnected world. Chi Young-suk, chairman of Elsevier, will also give a presentation on Wednesday on how universities can take advantage of their unique culture to fuel the transfer of knowledge. On Thursday, Joseph Aoun, president of Northeastern University and author of the book “Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,” will share insights on how universities could meet the challenges presented by smart machines. Aoun is expected to introduce a new curriculum for AI, stress the need for experimental learning and call for higher education to place lifelong learning at the heart of the educational enterprise. Anne Glover, CEO of Amadeus Capital, a United Kingdom-based investor in AI, is also among those who will deliver a speech. She is expected to talk about the “Triple Helix of Innovation,” aimed at boosting cooperation among universities, businesses and governments to create an ecosystem of nurturing and using young talent in the AI era. In addition, Mitsubishi Research Institute Chairman Hiroshi Komiyama, LG Electronics Senior Vice President Kim Byoung-hoon, Microsoft Director Alexandros Papaspyridis and Charmaine Dean, vice president of University of Waterloo, will also participate in the summit.In his welcoming speech, KAIST President Shin Sung-chul will express hopes for a global platform of partnership to devise innovative policies that are in line with the institute’s values -- challenge, creativity and caring -- to be established through the summit.

"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology placed fourth in industry, innovation and infrastructure in the 2019 Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings, KAIST said Thursday.  KAIST earned a nearly perfect score in patent, dissertation and research funding -- one of the specific indicators to measure its impact on society in achieving the United Nations’ ninth Sustainable Development Goal of industry, innovation and infrastructure. New Zealand’s University of Auckland topped THE’s overall Impact Ranking, followed by Canada’s McMaster University. University of British Columbia in Canada, and University of Manchester in the United Kingdom jointly ranked third. The inaugural THE University Impact Rankings, which recognizes universities’ impact on society based on the SDGs, was exclusively disclosed during the 2019 KAIST-THE Innovation & Impact summit Wednesday and published globally Thursday. The three-day summit on changing roles of universities in the era of the “fourth industrial revolution” was held from Tuesday to Thursday at KAIST’s main campus in Daejeon, bringing together some 300 leaders from 25 countries in the fields of education, industry and politics. The Impact Ranking was based on institutions’ success in delivering 11 of the 17 SDGs -- good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable consumption and production; climate action; peace, justice and strong institutions; partnerships for the goals. The ranking looks into institutional activities and efforts not covered in other rankings, with each SDG assessed across the three broad areas of research, outreach and stewardship.This year, more than 500 institutions from 75 countries in six continents submitted data for the new ranking, according to THE. “The indicators measuring universities’ impact should change as roles of universities diversify in line with diversifying global trends,” said Lee Jae-hyung, associate vice president of the international office at KAIST, adding it is a meaningful effort.Since KAIST set its “Vision 2031” to position itself as a leading university in creating global values in March, it has made efforts to innovate five sectors -- education, research, technology commercialization, globalization and ultimately future strategy. KAIST was selected Asia’s best innovative university for three consecutive years since 2016 in Reuters’ ranking of the world’s most innovative universities. The ranking recognizes educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries. “Taking the UN’s 17 SDGs as new indicators, KAIST, which has dedicated itself to producing knowledge that could be a growth engine for the country’s development, will become a leading university in creating global values,” said KAIST President Shin Sung-chul.During the three-day summit at KAIST’s main campus, former and incumbent presidents of some of the world’s most prestigious universities and business leaders shared their experiences, insights and development strategies. The participants focused on discussing four topics -- educational innovation, knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence and culture, and the Trip Helix of Innovation -- and drawing up institutions’ policy directions in Industry 4.0.()",KAIST placed 4th in innovation in THE University Impact rankings,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190404000615&ACE_SEARCH=1
"They claimed that KAIST’s Research Center for the Convergence of National and Artificial Intelligence would accelerate the “global competition to develop autonomous arms” which would “search for and eliminate targets without human control.” KAIST President Shin Sung-chul released a statement reaffirming that “KAIST does not have any intention to engage in the development of lethal autonomous weapons system and killer robots” and that the university was well-aware of the ethical concerns regarding the application of AI technology.The university also pledged to “not conduct any research activities counter to human dignity including autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control.”As the boycott has been called off, the researchers who were signatories to the boycott will “once again visit and host researchers from KAIST, and collaborate on scientific projects,” KAIST said.The boycott had been led by Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. It had come ahead of this week’s United Nations meeting in Geneva discussing the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons, often called “killer robots.”The meeting set to be held Monday will consider the military applications of AI and options for addressing the humanitarian and international security challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons systems.

"Growing up students are taught to embrace diversity in all corners of life, think in other people’s shoes and to not judge a book by its cover.In South Korea’s fast-paced, results-focused workplaces, however, core values are often forgotten, with companies applying unilateral recruitment processes, leaving almost no room to spare for persons with disabilities.The right assistance and a shift in social perceptions are needed to pave the way for disabled people to excel at work, ultimately broadening the horizon of workplace diversity and harmony, experts said.Hwang Jee-hwan, a 20-year old with a developmental disorder, works at Gangnam store of SPAO, a SPA brand run by Eland World. He is in charge of sales preparation -- product inspection, security tag attachment and product display prep -- as well as serving customers from time to time. Hwang works shorter hours than some other staff -- 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. five days a week.“I feel proud of myself when I find the product customers are looking for in the warehouse. ... Having a good attitude, respecting the manager, and precisely expressing my feelings are vital at the workplace,“ Hwang said in a coffee meeting with The Korea Herald. Described by the store manager as having a “strong sense of responsibility,” Hwang is a person who goes by the books.Prior to joining SPAO in September 2017, Hwang had enrolled at Seoul Vocational Training Center for the Developmentally Disabled for three months.“Sometimes I feel like it is difficult to communicate with other workers, in particular when they talk fast. When I’m stuck in the situation I would ask them to repeat what they said, and they will repeat it for me,” Hwang said.Excelling in a different line of work, lawyer Kim Dong-hyun of the Seoul Advocacy Agency for Persons with Disabilities received the Seoul government’s grand award in the welfare category last week in recognition of his efforts in the court room practicing law for disabled people. The award ceremony was held last week in celebration of the country’s 39th Day of Persons with Disabilities.“I am very happy and humbled to receive the award. ... I’m not sure what I’ll try out next. I’m a fun-seeker who has been doing what I want at the time although I have not accomplished every goal. Let’s leave the future open,” lawyer Kim Dong-hyun told The Korea Herald in an interview last week.Kim has a category 1 visually impairment due a medical accident that occurred while he was studying at Yonsei University Law School. Having completed his bachelors degree at KAIST, South Korea’s most prestigious engineering university, Kim had envisioned to become a lawyer specialized in IT.“As a lawyer I am grateful for not having to make decisions that goes against my conscious. My job is to help persons with disabilities that have been victimized as opposed to squeezing defense for criminals,” Kim said.Kim is currently waiting for a verdict slated next month on a case involving a disabled person in his 40-somethings who was unjustly denied the right to join a life insurance.Before moving to the Seoul Advocacy Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Kim worked at the Seoul High Court as the first disabled judicial researcher.Receiving necessary supportAs part of efforts to support employment of persons with developmentally disabilities, the government has opened seven vocational training centers for the developmentally disabled country wide with additional plans to build six more until the end of this year, according to Korea Employment Agency for the Disabled.Hwang Jee-hwan was able to land a position at SPAO on his second try after coaching received at the Seoul vocational training center.Opened in 2016, the center equipped with a replica of a SPAO store and 13 other real-life settings trains approximately 100 students a year. It is crucial for students for developmental disabilities to repetitively practice the given task and experience the work first-hand in a real-life setting to feel comfortable on-site, the deputy director of the center said. “It has become inevitable for companies to consider employment of disabled people due to government policy. Most persons with disabilities who are able to join the workforce are those with developmental disabilities. They are young, healthy, honest and genuine -- attractive human resources. But we ask companies to adjust entry standards, divide work hours and tasks,” Kim Jeong-yeon, deputy director of the Seoul Vocational Training Center for the Developmentally Disabled, told The Korea Herald.“Such cooperation and consideration would ultimately improve the work environment as it would encourage a culture of sharing and repecting diversity.”Though the country has a long way to go, the number of employeed disabled people totaled 175,935 people, showing an employment rate of 2.76 percent as of Dec 2017 compared to 0.43 percent in 1991, the agency said.Under the Korean law it is mandatory for private companies with over 50 workers to make up 3.1 percent of its work force with people with disabilities, and the ratio stands at 3.4 percent at state-run institutions and companies. Those that do not meet the quota are levied a penalty, which varies by company.The center works jointly with 14 companies, among which the center noted that SPAO was the most cooperative, with one developmentally disabled employee working at each of SPAO’s 54 stores nationwide.SPAO also sends its store managers to train students for job seekers at the center to feel comfortable during the interview and after employment.As for lawyer Kim Dong-hyun, the help he receives from a personal assistant provided by the Korea Employment Agency for the Disabled plays a key role in completing his job.The assistant checks for typos, converts paper documents to computer files, makes sure the right documentary evidence has been attached among other tasks.“Separate from my work competence, assistance is very important,” Kim said.“The assistant I currently work with is meticulous, so she straightens out my mistakes. Inevitably there are parts I miss, and it is vital to overcome these shortcomings with proper help.”Overcoming hardshipNeither Hwang nor Lee reached the level of stability at work in one go. They had faced obstacles and frustration, which they overcame due to strong bonds with friends and family. Laughing off the frustration faced after losing his sight, Kim Dong-hyun said he headed to a buddhist temple to complete 3,000 bows in desparation hoping for a miracle before returning to law school. A full bow starts with bowing the forehead to the floor, standing upright and then bowing again.On top of his drive to become a lawyer, Kim Dong-hyun said two close friends with vision impairment -- judge Choi Young and doctor Kim Jeong-ho -- motivated him to get back on his feet. “I was confident I could pursue a career as a lawyer as long as I don’t give up thanks to judge Choi Young who has set a good example,” Kim said. “Judge Choi Young and Dr. Kim Jeong-ho helped me pull myself together. We’d meet up for workout sessions and hang out every Saturday. In a way they are my mentors, who showed me that many things are possible even with sight loss,” Kim added.Next challenge?Aspiring to follow the footsteps of judge Choi, who became the country’s first judge with impaired vision in 2012, Kim’s next challenge is to become a judge.Kim, who ranked the country’s fourth best showdown player in last year’s National Sports Festival, also shared plans to compete this year. Showdown is a sport for the visually impaired that is similar to air hockey. In the meantime, Hwang may be seen behind the cashier in the future. Acknowledging that it won’t be an easy journey, Hwang said it is a next step he is eyeing.“I want to learn how to use POS (cashier). It is hard for disabled people to learn how to function the device because some of the tasks such as typing in the promotion code and refunds are done manually,” Hwang said.“It is nice to see workers serve customers (at the cashier). I think it is cool,” he added. By Kim Bo-gyung ()",[Feature] Opening up workplaces to people with disabilities,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190421000063&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Whether we know it or not, we are heavily guided by our emotions when making decisions or forming an opinion. For instance, you might unconsciously choose to buy a particular facial cream after being exposed to the product in an advertisement that used background music that you liked.And it’s no surprise that consumer businesses go to great lengths to understand people’s emotions. They heavily invest in collecting concrete, scientific evidence to improve their marketing tactics, by analyzing facial expressions and voice responses or text-mining through customer surveys. But could technology help us better understand emotions? For South Korean tech startup Looxid Labs, the answer lies in virtual reality, a next-generation technology platform with new capabilities and potential. VR involves a person wearing a head-mounted display. By design, VR headsets directly touch the forehead and stay close to the eyes, and can therefore collect data from the wearer in ways that a fitness band or smartphone cannot.This includes biological cues like brain waves and gaze, both of which are heavily linked to how a person is responding to what he or she is seeing. And here, Looxid Labs founder and CEO Chae Yong-wook saw a lucrative business opportunity.  Founded in 2015, the Seoul-based startup has developed what it claims is the world’s first mobile VR headset equipped with both eye-tracking and brainwave sensor technologies -- the emotion-tracking LooxidVR. The device comes in two forms -- as a standalone mobile VR headset to which a smartphone can be strapped, and an attachable accessory that works with existing VR headsets. Right now, the add-on is compatible with HTC’s Vive, with development underway for linkage to the Samsung Odyssey and Oculus Rift.How does it work? The LooxidVR headset fits comfortably on your head. Once worn, the device uses eye-tracking sensors to track eye movement and pupil size as you’re viewing a certain piece of content. Sensors touching your forehead track the brain waves coming from the frontal lobe.The biological signals that are picked up are analyzed via machine learning algorithms, to draw conclusions on what kind of emotions were felt. It presents a new form of analysis within the VR platform. “The biggest benefit (of our VR device) is being able to detect the ‘unspoken language’ of users that could not be tracked before,” Chae said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. “It’s a new and better way of acquiring direct emotive data from consumers.” For instance, a popular way to judge the effectiveness of an anti-smoking ad was through a post-viewing survey asking the viewer how they felt. But with LooxidVR and its analytic solutions, data such as a viewer’s stress level and gaze at certain parts of the ad can be tracked and analyzed.The device could observe that high-frequency brain waves associated with stress are peaking at a scene where a smoker is experiencing acute pain from years of smoking. This would tell companies, frame-by-frame, whether a message is working, or not working.LooxidVR has already won international acclaim, taking home the Best of Innovation Award in Virtual Reality at CES 2018. It is set to formally start sales in Korea and abroad from August.  So far, Looxid Labs has partnered with major Korean companies in the advertisement and auto industries as a strategic marketing tools provider. While LooxidVR is a useful solution for marketing optimization, the technology is also a good tool for improving mental training and education content made for VR platforms, Chae noted. According to the CEO, VR content is increasingly being used for psychological therapy -- for instance, as a relaxation tool for those in high-stress occupations or as a treatment option for conditions like ADHD. Education is also a big area, as students can learn by interacting with VR content. In this field, LooxidVR would help companies gauge the effectiveness of their content by providing objective, data-based feedback on how people are interacting with the VR materials, Chae explained.What Looxid Labs is doing is directly related to Chae’s expertise. The 36-year-old CEO holds a master’s degree in bio and brain engineering from KAIST with a specialty in brain-computing interface technology. His project at the university had involved developing sensors and algorithms that would enable robots to move in accordance with the brain waves of a human controller.While pursuing a Ph.D., Chae left his studies to co-found Ybrain, a health-tech startup that has built a headband that treats depression by stimulating the frontal lobe of the brain with a weak stream of electricity. With hopes of launching a product closer to his original field, Chae founded Looxid Labs.Over the next five years or so, Looxid Labs wants to successfully promote its “Emotive VR” technology to procure stable profits and collect big data on people’s biological cues to build better AI systems for emotion analysis.With the accumulated data and techniques, the startup hopes to eventually create an “emotive AI” that goes beyond replacing repetitive tasks for humans, but to understand human emotions on a personal level. “My dream is to create an emotive AI like that of the movie ‘Her’ which can console humans when they’re sad and be happy for them during good times,” Chae said. “The next-generation AI will understand people’s feelings and act like humans, and I expect it to find many applications in VR.”By Sohn Ji-young ()",[Health-tech Korea] Looking into human emotions through VR,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180527000229&ACE_SEARCH=1
"While operating in the volatile market of South Korea comes with many challenges, the trendsetting consumer base highly responsive and loyal to global brands have also created a different kind of phenomenon – “gapjil” of multinational firms.Gapjil is a Korean term which refers to the abuse of power by someone against a person in a weaker position.Apple, for one, has long been the king in the telecommunication market here, on many aspects.“I don’t think this is a common thing for telecom companies to bear all of the costs of promoting a new smartphone as such expenses are normally shared with handset makers in the case of Samsung or LG,” said one official from a local telecom company, talking about the practice of Apple dumping its advertising and repair costs on mobile carriers.Apple Korea has faced criticism over the past few years from local mobile carriers for passing the costs for promoting iPhone sales, including costs for advertisements, launch events and even repairs. The Fair Trade Commission is currently looking into the case and sent an examination report to Apple Korea for explanation earlier this month. The FTC is reportedly set to impose around 100 billion won ($94 million) on Apple Korea, but the telecom operators say “things will not change anyway” because of Apple’s superior status in supplying its new phones every year. The iPhone maker is not the only multinational firm facing criticism for abusing its market power here.Google is another target of the antitrust watchdog, over its alleged unfair business practice against local game companies. There are industry rumors that Google punishes a game developer if it uploads its game not only on Google Play but on different major app markets such as OneStore. Some game companies reportedly claim their games are excluded from “Google Featured,” the main screen of Google Play, when they upload their games on OneStore. No big games from Nexon, NC Soft and Netmarble are currently uploaded on OneStore, a local app market jointly made by Naver, KT and LG Uplus, last year. The spokespersons of the three game firms said they have nothing to say about Google officially, and Google Korea also denied it, saying, “There is no disadvantage to (game firms) when they launch (their games) in another app market.”However, a senior government official told The Korea Herald, “They can’t probably say anything due to the enormous power (Google).” The official requested anonymity citing how the matter is sensitive and the investigation is ongoing. “The government normally begins investigation when it finds something suspicious or receives complaints from companies. In Google’s case, (the investigation) began for both reasons.”Google Play currently dominates the app market with more than a 60 percent share in Korea. Apart from the alleged unfair business practice of abusing its market power, multinational firms are also blamed for getting a free ride or not paying taxes properly by using legal loopholes. Foreign tech firms, including Google and Facebook, have been embroiled in controversy for not paying for network as their server is located outside the country, unlike local tech firms such as Naver and Kakao that pay tens of billions of won for using network every year. The Korea Communications Commission and lawmakers have continued to raise the issue as Google and Facebook generate massive online traffic and gain huge profits through mobile videos without paying a single penny. The latest report released by the National Assembly said, “The government should actively be involved in the network issue so that reverse discrimination among content producers can be addressed.” Many of the “benefits” lawfully enjoyed by such multinational firms are due to the system of limited liability companies, a form of business organization without obligation to external audits or disclosure of financial information. Korean arms of Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, HP, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Pizza Hut and Coca-Cola are all registered as LLCs. And progressive lawmakers on the back of the liberal administration have now begun voicing against them.“In the past, we relaxed regulations on foreign companies to attract their investment. Things have changed now and we should monitor whether they create jobs, pay proper taxes or bring new technologies,” said Rep. Kim Hae-young from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea. The government revised the ordinance of external audit law to force LLCs into receiving external audits and disclosing financial information such as sales, operating profits, net profits, dividend and taxes. The revised regulations are expected to take effect in November 2019. But such moves are also colliding with critics.There are experts who say harsh regulations on global firms is out of sync with the free market economy.“The market issues should be left for the private sector and not be swayed by political and emotional perspectives. If their products have a problem, consumers will not opt for them and if they have a tax problem, the National Tax Service should be involved in it,” said Lee Byung-tae, a professor at KAIST College of Business.“Too negative a view toward global firms will eventually make them leave here,” Lee said. An executive from the US-based multinational tech company said, “Koreans seem to have a negative view on foreign companies doing business here. This seems because most foreign companies are exposed to the public only when negative incidents or issues take place.”“We still hope more people are aware that foreign firms here also contribute to the Korean economy through investment, jobs and taxes.”By Shin Ji-hye ()",[Doing Biz in Korea] Multinational firms accused of ‘gapjil’,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180419000794&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Hyundai Mobis, the auto parts making unit of Hyundai Motor Group, has implemented artificial intelligence to its software screening process and document search system for improved efficiency and accuracy, the company said Sunday.The move came in line with the company’s latest efforts to shift into a software-centered company and to diversify the use of AI in research and development.The AI-based software screening system, dubbed Mobis Artificial Intelligence Software Testing, jointly made with a professor of South Korea’s top science and technology university KAIST, will screen new software based on algorithm made by researchers, the company said. By automating the process, Hyundai Mobis expects to enhance work efficiency, shortening the time it takes to develop software while improving accuracy.“With MAIST replacing 50-70 percent of researchers’ workload, they are now able to work in a creative environment, focus on speeding up software creation and boost capabilities in algorithm development,” Hyundai Mobis said.By the second half of this year, Mobis will implement MAIST in all software-based areas, advance driving assistance systems and eco-friendly vehicle research as well as at its global software research center in India.As vehicles are becoming increasingly automated, about 30 percent of a vehicle is expected to be made up of software in 2030 from the current 10 percent, according to global consulting firm McKinsey & Company.A chatbot named MAIBOT has also been introduced to help researchers search through roughly 200,000 software-related documents. Mobis plans to adapt the AI system in different parts of the company by next year.As part of its long terms plans to beef up its software capabilities, the company will increase the number of human resources in the area to 4,000 professionals by 2025 from the current 800, it said.Hyundai Mobis hired former Continental engineer Carsten Weiss as the vice president of its in-vehicle infotainment software development division this May. By Kim Bo-gyung ()",Hyundai Mobis increases AI use for improved efficiency,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180722000186&ACE_SEARCH=1

"The Korean media like international rankings and report on them frequently. During the boom years, Korea’s rankings in gross domestic product growth and per capita GDP made for big headlines, but things have changed now that growth has slowed.In recent years, the standing of Korea’s universities, particularly according to the London-based Times Higher Education World University Rankings, have attracted media attention. The media use the annual results to lament about the low standing of Korean universities.For the 2019 rankings, 1,258 universities around the world were ranked according to five categories: teaching, research, citations, industry income and international outlook. The categories are weighted with teaching, research and citations accounting for 90 percent of the rank. International outlook accounts for 7.5 percent and industry income 2.5 percent. Times Higher Education also ranks universities by reputation and uses this information to derive part of the teaching and research rankings. The rest of the rankings are composed of data from a variety of sources.As in past years, the highest-ranking Korean university in the 2019 survey is Seoul National University at No. 63. For the first time, Sungkyunkwan University at No. 82 was the second-highest ranking Korean university; KAIST at No. 102 dropped to third place. Rounding out the top 200 for which specific rankings are given were Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) at No. 142 and Korea University at No. 198. Universities below 200 are ranked together in groups of 50 and 100. Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and Yonsei University ranked in the 201-250 group.The Times Higher Education World University Rankings is not the only league table of world universities. The oldest ranking is the Academic Ranking of World Universities, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, which started in 2003. This ranks the top 500 universities in the world according to research output, including factors such as the number of Nobel Prize-winning alumni. QS World University Rankings were part of the Times Higher Education but began publishing independent rankings according to their own methodology in 2009. Each of these rankings have been criticized for flaws in methodology and an Anglo-American bias.Korean universities fare poorly in the Shanghai Ranking, with none appearing in the top 100. Seoul National ranks in the 101-150 group, and Sungkyunkwan University comes in second in the 151-200 group. Hanyang University, KAIST, and Korea University fall in the 201-300 group.Korea does better in the QS World University Rankings, where Seoul National University ranks No. 36 followed closely by KAIST at No. 40. POSTECH and Korea University are close together at No. 83 and No. 86, respectively; Sungkyunkwan University is No. 100 and Yonsei No. 107.Of the three rankings, the research-focused Times Higher Education World University Rankings and Shanghai Ranking yield similar results, which suggest that Korean universities do not rank high in research. Korean universities do better in the QS World University Rankings, which place less emphasis on research and more weight on education-related indicators such as student-faculty ratio.As the media took interest in the rankings, university administrators and policymakers began to take them more seriously. Since the late 2000s, universities have pressured professors to increase research output, and the government has increased research funding for universities, particularly for science and technology.Universities are not the only place in Korea where advanced research takes place. As the economic boom gained steam in the 1970s, the government began to fund advanced research at specialized research institutes. KAIST grew from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science, which was founded by a loan from the United States Agency for International Development. Other government research institutes followed, and many are concentrated in Daejeon, where KAIST is currently located.Korean chaebol also spend heavily on R&D. In 2015, Samsung was fifth in the world for R&D spending, sitting between Intel and Microsoft. Overall, Korea ranked fifth in the world for R&D spending and first among major economies for R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. In 2014, Korea ranked fourth in the world for patent applications and patents granted, and first in patent applications for per capita GDP and per capita.Korea is clearly a research powerhouse despite the weakness of its universities. This is like Japan and Germany where universities are weak compared to the size of the economy, technological prowess, and overall spending on R&D. In thinking about Korean universities, the right question to ask is how they can contribute to society and add to what Korea already does well.Robert J.

"Kim Sang-hoon, 29, with type B blood rarely takes part in conversations about blood types linked with personalities. “Koreans have the misperception that a man with type B blood is selfish, a womanizer or hot-tempered. I don’t want people to judge me in such a way before getting to know me,” he said. Despite no scientific proof that blood types and personalities are linked, Koreans often ask about blood types to predict someone’s personality -- sometimes going further to judge relationships and career.According to a survey done last year on 1,500 people by Gallup Korea, 58 percent of the respondents said they believe blood types are correlated with personalities. The general view of people with type A blood is that they are timid but considerate, placing high value on manners and ethics. A person with type B blood is regarded as being friendly but selfish. A person with type O blood is confident but sometimes aggressive, wanting to be a leader. A person with type AB blood is thought to be intelligent but critical or aloof. Koreans’ perception of such traits sometimes plays a part when choosing partners, though it is not a decisive factor.For instance, a woman with type A blood and a man with type O blood are said to be the best match, as a cheerful man with type O blood is in harmony with a considerate woman with type A blood. A couple of type AB blood is also considered a good match, as they are thought to be calm and rational when settling disputes. The worst couples are said to comprise a man with type B blood and a woman with type A blood. As they have opposite personalities, a self-conscious woman with type A blood and a freewheeling man with type B blood might often have quarrels. “Such misperception on the link between blood types and personalities sometimes actually ruins a relationship. Although the real problems lie in their personalities, some tend to blame things on their blood types,” said Choi Mee-jung, a psychotherapist at local counseling center Haple Lab. Koreans’ belief in the correlation between their blood types and personalities does not end there. It sometimes extends to their careers. According to a survey of 882 employees by recruiting firm Job Korea last year, 59 percent of the respondents said they believe blood types affect job duties. The survey found that people with type A blood are slightly more concentrated in office jobs that require meticulousness, while there were more people with type B blood perceived as freewheeling in production or on site jobs. More people with type O blood – perceived as sociable -- were found working in sales, while rational and negotiator people with type AB blood were found more in marketing and advertising -- though the differences were all slight.Despite the widespread myth about the correlation between blood types and personalities, the medical community in Korea dismisses the blood type personality theory as pseudoscience, saying personality has nothing to do with blood as it is formed by education and family background. Han Kyu-seob, a professor at Seoul National University Hospital, said, “When defining someone’s personality, five standards are normally used: nervous temperament, openness, introverted/extroverted, social skills and conscientiousness.”“There has been no scientific proof that there is any correlation between the standards and blood types,” Han said. Chung Jae-seung, a professor specializing in physics at KAIST, said Korea’s obsession with blood types originated in the 1920s from Japan, which had tried to justify its colonization by proving the nation’s superiority.

"KAIST, South Korea’s leading science and technology research university, will host a forum in Seoul on Thursday to discuss the ethics of artificial intelligence technology development as well as policymaking around the world. Titled “Taming Artificial Intelligence: Engineering, Ethics and Policy,” the forum will invite some of the world’s leading AI researchers, including those who recently made headlines for announcing a boycott of KAIST over its alleged contribution to developing autonomous “killer robots.”The AI researchers  after KAIST gave a public assurance that AI-based weapons would not be developed.

"RAYONG PROVINCE, Thailand -- Along a green lake in Wangchan Valley, students clad in purple-and-green uniforms stroll around a school campus surrounded by woods that stretch across the northern Rayong province in Thailand. They are part of some 200 students at the Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS) in 10th, 11th and 12th grades, who are chosen among some 5,000-7,000 applicants through a multilayered screening process each year. All of the students, as well as teachers, are required to stay on weekdays in dormitories or other facilities located some 160 kilometers southeast of Bangkok.The students, who are all Thai, make it a rule to use English as a medium in classes, which feature 3D printers, microcontrollers, seismic monitoring devices or electron microscopes with X-ray microanalysis. While largely following the national curriculum, the students must also engage in science, technology, engineering and math research projects.Comprising four schools -- energy science and engineering, molecular science and engineering, biomolecular science and engineering, and information science and technology -- the academy highly anticipates a boost in science and technology development capabilities in Thailand, especially in the Eastern Economic Corridor that spans three provinces in eastern Thailand -- Chonburi, Rayong and Chachoengsao.“KVIS has a vision of being a world-leading science high school, nurturing future researchers, inventors and innovators to strengthen sustainable national development,” said Rachain Kosanlavit, principal of KVIS, to participants of a recent ASEAN + 3 New Media Familiarization Trip hosted by the Thai Foreign Ministry.  Founded in 2015, KVIS has received Thai oil conglomerate PTT Group’s investment in academic facilities in Wangchan Valley -- alongside a graduate school, Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology. Through the project backed by Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, KVIS received some 6 billion baht ($185.3 million) for academic park construction.“PPT company has done so much on reforestation in the past for more than 10 years,” Kosanlavit said. “Now, they give donations to institutes like Vistec and KVIS as corporate social responsibility to educate our schoolchildren.”This comes in line with industry-academia cooperation led by the Thai private sector. Another Thai giant, petroleum refiner SCG Chemicals located in the EEC, has partnered with Oxford University in the United Kingdom to develop technology for its products since 2015. KVIS’ first two international partners were both Korean entities: Gyeonggi Science High School for the Gifted and Korea Science Academy of Kaist. For example, physics teacher Min Medhisuwakul and chemistry teacher Suranan Anantachaisilp, both faculty members of KVIS, joined KSA of Kaist for training in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Conversely, KSA chemistry teacher Chun Man-seog came to KVIS in late 2017 as a visiting professor. In addition, KVIS has hosted exchange programs for teams made up of Korean students and teachers. The exchange was made on the grounds of a memorandum of understanding between the two institutions in 2015. Other partner institutions are located in Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Russia, Taiwan, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Canada, according to Kosanlavit. “We emphasize activities with international schools abroad,” he said, adding that 3-year-old KVIS has 15 memorandums of understanding with 15 partner schools.” Efforts to make KVIS a research capability driver appear to have borne fruit.Research conducted at KVIS by its students was published in the journal Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia in 2016. The students’ use of an electron microscope in the central research laboratory contributed to the article titled “The Source of Silicon for Thai Riceberry Germinated on Top of an Aqueous Solution.”“Every science school is under different circumstances, and to some schools, the circumstances wouldn’t allow a school to focus on academic research,” Chun of KSA told The Korea Herald. “KVIS makes a strong case for a research-driven approach. Similar to what we do, KVIS has hired those holding Ph.D. degrees as faculty members, without any exception. This will enable (KVIS) to show students how to conduct (professional) academic research.”By Son Ji-hyoung Korea Herald correspondent ()","Private investment, international partnership feed budding Thai science school",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180930000099&ACE_SEARCH=1
"Samsung Electronics has reportedly been ordered to pay $400 million to the licensing arm of South Korea’s top science and research university KAIST over infringing a patent related to key semiconductor technology.A US federal jury in Texas ruled that the Korean tech giant infringed KAIST’s patent related FinFet -- a key transistor technology used to produce processors for mobile phones -- and should pay a fine, according to a Bloomberg report Saturday.Chipmakers Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries were also found to have infringed the patent, but reportedly were not ordered to pay damages.Samsung refuted that it worked with the Korean university to develop the technology, denied patent infringement and challenged the validity of the patent during the trial.Looking ahead, the Korean electronics giant plans to “consider all options to obtain an outcome that is reasonable, including an appeal,” Samsung told Bloomberg in a statement.The suit was filed in November 2016, by KAIST IP US, the university’s licensing arm which claimed the defendants have been infringing US Patent No. 6,885,055 that relates to FinFet. KAIST IP US had reportedly claimed that Samsung initially dismissed the FinFet technology research at first, but changed its attitude when rival Intel started licensing the invention and developing related products.The case marks a clash between Korea’s top science and engineering institution and the country’s biggest tech company and conglomerate, which often work together for talent acquisition and technology innovation.In the Texas jury decision, Samsung’s infringement was found to be “willful,” which means that the judge could raise the damages to award as much as three times the jury’s amount.By Sohn Ji-young ()",Samsung ordered to pay $400m to KAIST over semiconductor tech patent infringement,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180617000065&ACE_SEARCH=1

"An upgraded contact tracing system with better protection of individual privacy has been developed, a national research university said Wednesday.The Prevention System for Pandemic Disease Infection (PreSPI) uses the global positioning system, wireless local area network, Bluetooth, barometer and accelerometer built into most modern smartphones to follow the movement of individuals, according to the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).The data collected from the ""blackbox"" of a phone will only be held in a so-called signal form, without any place names, with access being given to health authorities who need such information in their quarantine work to stem the spread of COVID-19.KAIST added that all information managed by PreSPI will be automatically erased two weeks after it is created.Currently, South Korea's health authorities rely on credit card purchase records, public surveillance cameras and other related data, to track potential virus cases. This is time-consuming and has fueled privacy concerns.  A specially created app will allow people to quickly and accurately determine if they have unknowingly come into close contact with infected persons.In addition, the new system has a epidemiological investigation tool, permitting health and quarantine workers to trace the movement of an infected person on a map and to track people inside buildings in certain cases.

"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Wednesday that it had developed “black box” software for smartphones that would facilitate the tracking of COVID-19 patients’ movements without encroaching on their privacy.KAIST calls it “PreSPI,” short for Prevention System for Pandemic Disease Infection.The idea that carrying a movement tracker in a phone is conducive to safeguarding personal data may sound counterintuitive, but the new system is more than that, KAIST explained. “Think of this like an airplane black box -- it’s meant to hold all records of the aircraft’s journey, but no one opens it to see its data unless there is an accident,” professor Han Dong-soo of KAIST’s Intelligent Service Integration Lab told The Korea Herald.“Becoming a confirmed COVID-19 patient would be the equivalent of a crash landing. Even then, the information regarding their whereabouts over the past two weeks would be transmitted in coded signals and not as the names of commercial establishments they have patronized,” Han said.The disclosure of information about COVID-19 patients’ movements, including specific places they visited and when those visits took place, has ignited a public debate over privacy.With the new app, the data refreshes every two weeks, the time frame deemed to be the incubation period of the SARS CoV-2 virus, automatically deleting older records.The black box application, which can be downloaded just like any other smartphone app, will become publicly available if the South Korean government endorses it. All apps relevant to COVID-19 require government approval.Currently, alerts about newly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 carriers can cause confusion and alarm. Members of the public have to read through the list of places an infected person has been in case they too have been exposed. But users of the app can see if they should be concerned without checking those details. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Han’s team of some 20 researchers was already fine-tuning the technology to track a device’s movement within indoor settings. The technology, called the KAIST Locating System, was first developed by Han in 2014. Currently, it can pinpoint people’s movements with an accuracy range of 3 to 6 meters within a building and can tell which level of the building they visited.

"Since its inception in 2015, robo-investing has emerged as a tool with the potential to minimize the impact of market volatility in South Korea.The profitability of this investment method -- based on computerized data analysis, not human instinct -- has been questioned. But the time has come, unexpectedly, to prove who is correct. The catalyst is the coronavirus outbreak that has been rattling the stock market at home and abroad.According to market data tracker FnGuide, 17 robo-investing funds in Korea took an average of a 2.44 percent loss from January until Monday. In the past three months, with COVID-19 on the wane, the robo-investing funds, which mostly invest in foreign products, gained 8.2 percent.The combined volume of robo-investing funds -- created by asset management firms on the basis of automated trading algorithms -- came to 96.6 billion won ($79.83 million) as of Monday in the nation, where investors poured in some 270 trillion won in public funds. The volume shrank by 6.8 billion won in three months as retail investors in robo-investing funds cashed out their investments during the recovery.While the figures indicate a solid performance by robo-investing funds, it appears that the robo-investing mechanism still hinges on the human element. Automated as the funds are in terms of investment decision-making processes, it is human asset managers who construct portfolios and control factors, and investors still have to decide when to buy and when to exit from the funds.This, along with other factors such as target asset class, has resulted in a discrepancy in yields between automated funds.Nine out of 12 Korean AI funds -- excluding those that either are younger than 6 months old or have accumulated less than 1 billion won -- took losses from January until Monday, with the greatest loss amounting to 8 percent, the FnGuide data showed. Half retreated over 2 percent, while four out of 12 underperformed the average of active funds -- 2.85 percent loss -- investing in a mixed bag of foreign stocks and bonds. In the meantime, algorithms themselves appear to have stopped short of whetting investor appetite for such funds. None of the 10 feeder funds, which had pooled retail investors’ money publicly for at least a year, were managing less than 5 billion won.If a fund more than a year old is smaller than 5 billion won and fails to attract additional investments for at least a month, a fund manager may opt to liquidate the fund under the Korean rules. This has led some of the AI-powered fund managers to scrap their products later this year, including one created by NH-Amundi Asset Management and advised by robo-adviser engine developer December & Company.Experts say artificial intelligence itself is not a fortuneteller that can predict which stocks or bonds will perform better, and is not designed to fulfill that function.“(Robo-investing funds) seem to have failed to differentiate themselves from ordinary active funds or quantitative funds,” said Kim Woo-chang, associate professor of industrial and systems engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. “Speaking of profitability, robo-investing funds have yet to prove that its mechanism is superior to other traditional methodologies to manage a fund.”The question is where robo-advisers’ deep learning mechanism could come into play and have an edge over other funds.Some robo-adviser engine developers here argue that there is still room, saying the beauty of AI lies in its ability to predict when to buy or sell assets, instead of where.To implement AI-powered strategies, robo-advisers can bring in the algorithm that focuses on when to buy or sell, inspired by the concept known as “gamma” first introduced in 2013 by US financial services firm Morningstar.In this regard, there needs to be a clear distinction between creating a robo-investing fund -- focusing on automated choice of assets (“alpha”) and asset allocation (“beta”) -- and acting as a robo-adviser to offer a tailored portfolio depending on individual risk tolerance and other factors -- focusing on advising on the timing.“Decent financial advice from robo-advisers can make better portfolio decisions, which could lead to potential benefits to an investor’s return on assets,” said Julius Chun, head of robo-adviser engine developer startup Doomoolmori.Chun added that AI’s role is crucial in that sense, because such investment decisions are inferred and reached from myriad cases and experiences -- an area where big data analysis jumps in.Robo-advisers’ offers of investment advice powered by AI is in contrast with robo-investing funds, given the required human efforts from both buyers and sellers in funds.“Robo-investing funds are financial products to sell, whereas robo-adviser services are not,” December & Company CEO Chung In-young said. “Once the financial product is sold, individual investors who bought the product are responsible for taking care of the aftermath, because financial institutions’ role is limited to attracting retail investor money.”Chung added that robo-adviser services should strive to offer fully personalized investment advice to each individual, because otherwise the service will be no different from robo-investing fund products.For the past couple of years, Korea has moved to allow companies with AI technology to manage financial consumers’ money via online, as long as the 1.5 billion won capital requirement is met, through a series of deregulations.Still, from robo-advisers’ perspective, there is a long road to go to achieve independence from financial institutions and offer full-fledged financial services to address each individual’s needs.One could be to join a deregulation initiative by the government, under which a robo-adviser startup is expected to hone its methodology to analyze an individual’s characteristics as an investor.Chung of December said the company is looking to participate in a state-led pilot program called the “MyData” initiative, through which a licensed MyData operator is able to request the financial data of third parties.“An individual’s characteristics should be measured based on the data analyses, in addition to surveys,” Chung said.Chun of Doomoolmori said Korean robo-advisers are subject to tougher regulations, compared with those in the United States and the United Kingdom.“As a robo-adviser, there are numerous constraints as to how to reach out to a wider range of individual investors,” he said.Chun added that robo-advisers’ targets of investment are limited to exchange-traded funds, equity-linked securities and public equity funds. They have limitations when directly investing in equities.Kim of KAIST pointed to the power dynamic between large financial institutions with sales networks and robo-adviser service providers without such networks.“Without direct channels to reach out to a number of financial consumers, robo-advisers will remain underdogs,” Kim said. “But I believe the government is open to deregulations to encourage more financial technology firms to enter into an untapped realm.”By Son Ji-hyoung ()","[Weekender] As pandemic rages, funds test water with robo-investing",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200618000958&ACE_SEARCH=1

"An international online forum on the future of education amid the rise of distance learning in the post-coronavirus era will be held Wednesday, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Monday. Organized by KAIST’s Global Strategy Institute, the forum will take place between 9 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. at a conference hall at KAIST’s main campus in Daejeon, to be livestreamed on the YouTube channels of the school and state-funded broadcaster Korea TV.Some 15 global leaders in the education sector will be invited to give keynote speeches and take part in panel discussions on two topics -- innovating university education to nurture creativity and narrow the socioeconomic and digital divide caused by online learning.The forum will start with opening remarks from KAIST President Shin Sung-chul and welcoming remarks from prominent figures in the education sector -- including Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, and Higher Education Policy Institute Director Bahram Bekhradnia.KAIST President Shin Sung-chul will stress the importance of online education and virtual university as “the most optimal tools to provide lifelong education” in the fast-changing, technology-centered society after the pandemic, according KAIST. KAIST specially invited Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, the first-generation online learning platform, to discuss an innovative online education model in the contactless era, it said. Coursera is a worldwide online learning platform founded in 2012 that partners with top universities and organizations to offer free and paid online courses, skills certifications and degrees. On the topic of “digitization of higher education, coronavirus and afterwards,” Maggioncalda in his welcoming remark will look into how universities turned online for education and ways to strengthen digital innovation in high education, KAIST said. In the first day’s sessions, the focus will be on innovating university education, with keynote speakers including Minerva Project Founder and CEO Ben Nelson, Microsoft Education Vice President Anthony Salcito and Times Higher Education Chief Knowledge Officer Phil Baty. Nelson will offer his insights into how universities can increase accessibility and equity, what are internal and external factors affecting high education institutes’ decision-making processes and how learning experience could be improved in remote learning environment.Baty will help take the direction of innovating education by releasing major points of the survey Times Higher Education conducted on 200 presidents of universities from around the world. The survey was on the future of higher education after the COVID-19 pandemic, health and economic crisis. On the second day, experts will discuss the widening educational gap in the post-coronavirus era. Among the speakers are Rebecca Winthrop, senior fellow and co-director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institute; Kang Sang-wook, a senior official in charge of future human resources policy at the Ministry of Science and ICT; and Ham-Mukasa Mulira, chairman of the Virtual University of Uganda’s governing council. Kang from the Korean government will give a keynote speech on the problems laid bare by the opening of classes online -- the low quality of classes and the digital divide. He is to underscore the opportunities created by the COVID-19 crisis, saying the pandemic could speed up much-needed innovation in digital education, according to KAIST. About 158 million students were taking classes at home online as of the end of April due to school closures in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to statistics from UNESCO. This poses questions about quality of education and even about the need for physical university campuses. The forum follows a forum held by KAIST in April on global cooperation in the post-coronavirus era, which looked into the COVID-19 crisis and how it affects politics, economy, industry and education. “As a leader of innovating university education in Korea, KAIST arranged the forum to resolve educational issues in a contactless society, which was brought forward by COVID-19, together with the international society,” commented professor Kim Jung-ho, the head of KAIST’s Global Strategy Institute.By Lee Kwon-hyoung and Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)",KAIST to host online forum on future of education in post-coronavirus era,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200617000941&ACE_SEARCH=1
"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Monday its researchers have identified interferon as the cause of cytokine storm in severely affected COVID-19 patients.Interferon is a type of cytokine that has been known to bring up antiviral defenses against infections. While they have been known as the good cytokines, the researchers at KAIST believe they may trigger adverse effects in COVID-19 patients. This finding may provide grounds for new treatment approaches that target interferon, KAIST said. A cytokine storm, or hyper-inflammatory response, occurs when too much of cytokine is released, and the body starts to attack its own tissues. Cytokine storms are suspected of causing detrimental progression of COVID-19, but what causes this cytokine storms have been unclear, posing a hurdle in treating medium-grade COVID-19 patients. In their latest research, the KAIST scientists separated the immune cells from a COVID-19 patients’ blood, and applied single-cell-RNA-sequencing method to analyze their characteristics. Regardless of the degree of the SARS CoV-2 infection, the researchers repeatedly found tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 in patients’ immune cells. In comparing light and medium-grade patients, the researchers could see that a cytokine response called interferon was especially pronounced in medium-grade patients This study was published in Science Immunology on Friday under the title “Immunophenotyping of COVID-19 and influenza highlights the role of type I interferons in development of severe COVID-19.”Lee Jeong-seok and Park Seong-wan from KAIST’s Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, and Department of Biological Sciences, participated in the study as lead researchers.By Lim Jeong-yeo (kaylalim@heraldcorp.com)",KAIST identifies interferon as trigger to COVID-19 inflammations,http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200713000819&ACE_SEARCH=1

"A group of South Korean researchers has developed a 3D-based cell culture technique for human lung alveolar cells that become targets of COVID-19 infection, according to Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Monday. KAIST professor Ju Young-seok, who was on the research team, said the cell culture technique could artificially produce cells that mirror the cellular physiology and pathology of human lung alveolar cells. The technique would help other researchers to characterize pathogenesis of COVID-19 in detail, he added. The team said the recent invention could accelerate developments of vaccines and therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic as researchers would no longer have to carry out tests on laboratory animals or cells derived from them. “The culture technique will allow researchers to conduct tests on a wide range of respiratory infections,” Ju added. The research has been co-conducted by professors Lee Joo-hyeon from University of Cambridge, Ju Young-seok from KAIST, Choi Byeong-sun from the Korea National Institute of Health, Koh Gou-young from Institute for Basic Science, Kim Young-tae from Seoul National University Hospital and other researchers from Korean startup company GENOMEinSIGHT. Their research paper, titled “Three-dimensional human alveolar stem cell culture models reveal infection response to SARS-CoV-2,” has been published on peer-reviewed scientific journal Cell Stem Cell on Thursday last week.

"After years of sweeping change in all corners of society, Egypt has embarked on a journey to rebuild the nation, opening doors to foreign entities to capitalize on state-of-the-art technology and reclaim its glory days as an economic hub.As part of efforts to do so, Egypt is wooing South Korean businesses and leading science and tech institutions, the top Egyptian diplomat said.“Quite frankly, my humble opinion is that we have such a huge amount of untapped potential in relationship between the countries. … This exercise of match making needs some more focusing and some more facilitation in terms of opening those channels unleash that great potential. That’s what I’m trying to do,” Egyptian Ambassador to South Korea Hazem Fahmy told The Korea Herald in an interview at his office in central Seoul on Nov. 21. “Of all we are a country that is racing against in terms of development. One very key aspect of that is technology. Korea is very advanced in so many areas that we are hungry to have transfer of technology in. … The issue to transfer of technology is at the center of our foreign policy now.”Fahmy has been in Seoul for about two years, witnessing the PyeongChang Olympics firsthand and increased contact between the two countries.“It has been quite an exciting journey. First of all, I didn’t expect so many official delegations to visit me from capital. It’s a reflection that we are having a really energized relations,” he said.For Korean undergrads to better understand the 2008 and 2013 revolutions that have profoundly impacted the country, Fahmy delivers lectures on contemporary Egyptian history at universities here.At the core of his mission in Korea, however, is to attract companies and investors with a focus on technology to achieve the ambitious Egypt Vision 2030 launched in 2014 for Egypt to become a top 30 economy by 2030.Key mechanisms set in place to achieve its goal are the Suez Canal Economic Zone and investor-tailored measures.“Our ministers of investment, finance and the prime minister himself are committed, if there is a really serious strategic investor in any area, they are willing to provide any incentive that will facilitate their presence even by diverging from existing rules and regulations to attract this foreign direct investment,” Fahmy said.“We have never been, I think in our recent history, more proactive in these areas. … We are very much determined to attract those kind of FDIs that will deepen the transfer of knowledge.”As the country makes all out efforts for development, it has started a mega infrastructure project building 14 new cities, including an administrative capital and upgraded transportation system.“We have a lot of catching up to do. We are currently having mega infrastructure projects in order to pave the road for deepening of industry and absorption of foreign technology,” Fahmy said.“This requires a lot of regular construction a lot of smart cities you need to wire them with gadgets of new technologies and digital technologies you are very good in.”The country is not only talking the job to bring in Korean companies. To promptly address complaints frequently raised by Korean businesses concerning Egypt’s bureaucratic system, the Egyptian government has set up a committee under the Prime Minister’s Office last month composed of officials across ministries to exclusively deal with matters related to Seoul.Fahmy went on to say, “This new mechanism was dealt into give priority for speedy resolution of any problems they might have in that regard. … We are not there yet as we would like to be, but sure we are working very hard on it.”Egypt is backed by a population of 100 million people and a free trade network that includes Africa, the EU, Turkey and Arab countries that opens access to 1.8 billion people.According to Fahmy, South Korean companies can cash in on Egypt’s strong growth and positive economic prospects by raising their risk profile to encompass Egypt from their current US and China-dependent portfolio.“Mainly your partners are either the immediate neighborhood or you have a very heavy concentration on China and the United States … you need to diversify your markets. … So it should open huge opportunities for Korean business and investments whether in Egypt as a springboard or for Egypt itself that is a huge market,” Fahmy said. Asked about his most memorable moment in Seoul, Fahmy noted his encounter with Korean President Moon Jae-in in January last year when he delivered his credentials. “I was very impressed. … He (Moon) opened quite a few substantive issues and he was quiet familiar with important details of bilateral relations, which he raised unexpectedly and pleasantly,” Fahmy said.Indicative of Egypt’s drive to leap forward in the field of science and information and communication technology, Fahmy also touched on his visits to South Korea’s top science and technology university, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and the state-run Korea Institute of Science and Technology, describing it as a “privilege and honor” in which he “takes pride in.”“Just the presence of science in such a strong way and the inventions that are being done in these institutions and the role they played in building the new modern Korea was so impressive,” Fahmy said.“We are trying to have a branch of KAIST in Egypt, because we know the role it played in modernizing Korea. We hope to be able to copy that model. We are also having contacts with many of your prime universities trying to have some cooperation with Egypt in that regard.” By Kim Bo-gyung ()","[Diplomatic circuit] [Meet the diplomat] Egypt is eager for transfer of technology, economic growth: Egyptian envoy",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20191209000573&ACE_SEARCH=1
"If one’s influence on the future can be taken as a measure of one’s greatness, a new study has added to Beethoven’s credentials as a great composer: Researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have found him to have the most influence on the composers that came after him.Park Ju-yong, a professor at KAIST Graduate School of Culture Technology, and his team published a paper online in EPJ Data Science on Jan. 30 that quantifies novelty and influence of famous composers by developing an algorithm to analyze 900 piano compositions by 19 composers.After converting musical pieces into sequences of “codewords” that correspond to combinations of simultaneously played notes, Park used the algorithm to evaluate the novelty and influence of the codeword transitions in each piece. A comparison of the values among the piano composers, who were all active between 1700 and 1900, showed Beethoven to have had the highest influence on future composers, while Rachmaninoff was found to be the most innovative composer.The research showed Handel as the most influential during the Baroque period, Mozart and Haydn during the Classical period and Beethoven during the Romantic period. Beethoven was the most influential composer for nearly 100 years after his death up to 1900, the end point of the data set for the research.The study also showed novelty is not the sole reason for recognition, as Beethoven’s novelty value was among the lower half. “That isn’t to say Beethoven wasn’t novel compared to his contemporaries. He is compared with other famous composers in this paper which puts Beethoven relatively low on the scale of novelty. The case of Beethoven is interesting because the novel attempts he made were considered important and regarded in the highest esteem by many,” said Park. “There is a somewhat positive correlation between novelty and influence, but too much novelty can lead to discomfort. This is similar to the Wundt curve in psychology where a moderate level of stimuli can be pleasing, but intense stimuli can be displeasing.”The researchers evaluated the originality of the pieces in two ways: how distinct a composer’s work was from his previous works -- or personal novelty -- and how distinct it was from the work of previous composers – historical novelty. These two measures tended to correlate – when personal novelty was high, historical novelty was higher. One interesting outlier was Classical-period composer Clementi, whose work had high personal novelty but low historical novelty, providing an explanation as to why he was highly regarded during his time, but not as much in later times.“This means that while he produced works distinct from his own earlier works (even more so than Handel, Mozart, and Haydn, and on par with Beethoven), they as a whole would sound conventional when compared with other composers’,” the researchers wrote. Rachmaninoff, the famous Romantic era composer, was shown to be the most novel of the 19 composers, continuously trying distinct styles not only from past conventions but also from his previous works.Park’s algorithm can be applied to otehr fields, such as literature, art and architecture where codewords could correspond to word, color or shape.“We have shown that the problem of quantifying creativity of artistic creations, which has hindered research, can be solved by using big data and network science,” said Park. “As the presence of artificial intelligence grows in field of artistic creation, this result can help contribute to the creation of artificial creativity that can maximize human creativity and artistic talent.”By Lim Jang-won ()","KAIST team uses data to show Beethoven’s influence, Rachmaninoff’s novelty",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200207000459&ACE_SEARCH=1

"When a team of South Korean researchers published research last month on a potential approach to treating bowel cancer, there was a huge buzz in the scientific media.There was no drug candidate for the approach but if one were found it could, in theory, mean that not just this, but other types of cancer could become a chronic illness rather than a life threatening condition. It would require years of study from here on, but at the end of our research will come the day when cancer patients would live life to their fullest, as the malignant tumors would have become benign ones that can be controlled with medication like any other chronic illness,” Cho Kwang-hyun, the lead researcher of the study, told The Korea Herald.Cho’s study, which made the January cover of international journal Molecular Cancer Research, involves adjusting the biological control mechanisms in cancer cells to stop them reproducing. If it leads to a drug being found, it could not only be more effective, but also less toxic to the patient than existing treatments. A cancer cell has a lot of accumulated mutations that makes undoing them all a very complicated and difficult process, so treatments have generally been directed at killing the mutated cells. But in doing so, the treatments also killed healthy cells, causing numerous side effects for patients. This study was limited to colorectal cancer, but he believes this same approach of re-regulating cell’s control mechanisms could be used to treat other cancers.Cho has an unusual background for a cancer researcher. He started in electronic engineering, and began as early as 1999 to apply control engineering to biology. Control engineering was developed more than 200 years ago, as a way to operate complex mechanisms and systems using feedback to make corrections. That could be as simple as the temperature regulator in your fridge, or much more complicated, like the automatic systems that keep planes and satellites flying.“I began to study the convergence of control engineering with life science after coming to think that our bodies, too, have an advanced system that works in the most complex ways to keep us alive without our active awareness,” Cho said. When Cho was starting out in this newfound research interest of his in the late 1990s, not much work had been done to solve the puzzles of life from a control engineering perspective. Cho has researched internationally in Sweden, Ireland, the UK, the US and China -- and in the stream that is now known as systems biology, he is one of the leading researchers.For this study that pitched to revert colorectal cancer cells back to normal-like cells, Cho’s team mathematically modeled the complex regulation networks of a living organism and through computer simulation analysis and biological experiments, defined the molecular target to take out the malignancy in the cancer cell. Cho’s latest study identified an epigenetic regulator called SETDB1 that prevents cancer cells from naturally reverting back to normal. Cho and his team found that inhibiting SETDB1 would activate transcription factors that stop the proliferation of cancer cells.The team used a biological molecule called small hairpin RNA to inhibit SETDB1, and found that this ended the mass-proliferation of cancer cells, indicating that the cancer cell, once a malignant tumor, became benign and under control.The entire process was conducted on an organoid, which is a miniaturized replica of an organ grown in the lab from tissue or stem cells.“It is my hope to continue this research so that we can give hope to patients whose condition has exacerbated to the state that no other treatments can help,” Cho said. The goal, as hopeful as it is, would require extensive time and investment to materialize.It takes at least 10 years to find a drug candidate and clinically test it so that it can be prescribed.Any medical treatment, for it to be safe, has to be tested on animals, and go through a phase 1 clinical trial in a small batch of healthy people, then through phase 2 and 3 clinical trials to test for side effects and to see how well it works. While Cho’s team has shown SETDB1 inhibition could alleviate colorectal cancer in the lab, they are yet to find a drug candidate that can be used in clinical trials. Securing research funding for the length of time until this potential drug candidate is found and developed to commercial stage is a tough obstacle, Cho said. The team will try to carry on the research to pre-clinical stage. Cho is mulling potentially setting up his own startup.Cho acknowledged that there was quite likely to be better targets than SETDB1 given further in-depth research, and that his team would continue to research for more effective doors to break through to capitulate cancer. Cho is the associate vice president of research at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon. His team consists of fellow KAIST scientists, and Samsung Medical Center researchers.

"Korean companies Genexine and Binex will jointly develop potential COVID-19 vaccine “GX-19,” in hopes of preventing yearly seasonal flus showing respiratory symptoms, the companies said Monday.GX-19 will be a DNA vaccine, developed using Genexine’s platform technology and manufactured at Binex’s “good manufacturing practice”-abiding facility.A DNA vaccine involves a DNA delivery vector fitted with the genetic information of a particular virus, to which the human immune system may safely develop a defense mechanism. Genexine will inject the DNA of the COVID-19 virus in its delivery vector to test it.US biotech Inovio has similar technology which it is using in COVID-19 vaccine development. In its research efforts, Inovio had been exempted from the US’ Food and Drug Administration’s toxicity test requirement, and was given a grant of up to $9 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.In an effort to expedite domestic research, Genexine on Friday had declared the formation of a consortium comprising itself, Binex, the International Vaccine Institute, GenNBio, kaist and postech for the development of GX-19. Genexine and Binex will begin manufacturing clinical samples from March. The consortium expects to turn in a clinical test design to the drug ministry by June.“Through this co-development of GX-19, we wish to establish the ground on which we may promptly develop vaccine given whatever novel virus’s advent,” said Genexine and Binex officials.

"A university approval committee of the Education Ministry permitted Korea Electric Power Corp. on Friday to set up a legal entity to create and manage a university for engineering degrees.Kepco will proceed with follow-up measures with a goal of opening the university in March 2022, two months before the end of the Moon Jae-in presidency.The state utility says the new university will develop the world’s most talented energy engineers. Atomic power is an energy field where Korea’s technological excellence has been globally recognized. But Moon’s nuclear phase-out policy tore down much of the ecosystem of the nation’s atomic power industry and its cultivation of future nuclear engineers. Now, it is pushing to develop the world’s best energy engineers through a new university. It is absurd to try to produce qualified engineers anew after disabling an existing ecosystem that produces them.Korean universities and colleges already offer a variety of energy engineering disciplines. Graduates who majored in them work in related fields. Besides, Korea has five engineering-specialized universities, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Pohang University of Science and Technology.Kepco argues that its engineering university will serve a regionally balanced development. But the Chungcheong region has KAIST, the Gyeongsang region Postech, and the southwestern region has Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. Furthermore, GIST’s energy engineering programs are similar to those planned for Kepco’s university. Above anything else, Korea is in no position to host a new university. Declines in the school-age population and enrollment put about a quarter of provincial universities and colleges at the risk of shutting down. The Education Ministry has been seeking to downsize universities as a high-priority task. Now the ministry is taking procedures to establish a new university. It is not only unfit for the current situation but a waste of national resources.Kepco earned 5 trillion won to 12 trillion won ($4 billion-$10 billion) from 2014 to 2016, but suffered 1.35 trillion won in operating losses last year. Its debt swelled from 107 trillion won in 2015 to 128 trillion in 2019.Its profitability turned negative under the Moon administration. Affected by its nuclear phase-out policy, Kepco reduced the cheapest power generation using atomic energy and instead increased costly methods such as using liquefied natural gas imports.Kepco estimated its university will cost 1.61 trillion won over 13 years, but the company itself is making a loss.Nonetheless, the government twisted Kepco’s arm, noting it was Moon’s election pledge to establish a Kepco university. The right thing to do is to shelve or drop the pledge because Kepco’s losses are snowballing. The government should pursue its policies flexibly depending on the situation, but the Moon administration has pushed its policies, particularly election pledges, obstinately. If it wants to establish an engineering specialized university in Jeolla, it would be more economical and rational to take over or invest in a local university.Kepco is 51 percent owned by the government and 49 percent by the private sector. About 420,000 Korean individual investors hold Kepco stocks. A group of minority shareholder activists filed a lawsuit last year accusing the president and the energy minister of coercing Kepco into following demands or policies that caused losses, and Kepco’s management of malfeasance. It is obvious that Kepco has made a senseless decision.To establish a university is not an urgent matter for Kepco or the nation. Still, the government approved the plan. It’s likely there was an intent to win support from Jeolla voters. Many companies and households are staggering due to the new coronavirus. The government announced bold relief measures for them. In this situation, it is carrying out plans that would put a heavy burden on Kepco, which is flailing in the red largely due to the government’s energy policy. To reduce the state utility’s losses, raising electric charges look inevitable and after that, production costs will certainly rise. Probably Moon and the ruling camp may brag about a new engineering university but the burden will be borne by the people.

"An international online forum on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on political, economic and educational systems will held Wednesday, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Monday. Organized by KAIST’s Global Strategy Institute, the forum will start at 9 a.m. at KAIST’s main campus in Daejeon.“The forum’s theme is ‘global cooperation in the coronavirus era,’ and it was organized by KAIST to predict the crisis faced by the international society beyond quarantine and medical issues to politics, economy, industry and education systems,” KAIST said in a statement. “And to seek international cooperation and multidirectional responses to efficiently overcome the crisis.”The forum includes keynote speeches and panel discussions from experts from diverse fields ranging from vaccines to artificial intelligence and government policies. “The forum was arranged to gain insight into the global social and economic impact of COVID-19, and to predict the future that will unfold,” Prof. Kim Jung-ho, the head of KAIST’s Global Strategy Institute, said.“International cooperation not only in developing vaccines and treatments, but a scientific approach including (the use of) artificial intelligence will be put forward.”The forum will start with opening remarks from Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun; KAIST President Shin Sung-chul; Uri Sivan, president of Technion – Israel Institute of Technology; and Peter Lee, head of Microsoft Research. Chung’s speech is to focus on South Korea’s response to the outbreak, which has drawn attention around the world, and on its efforts to assist and cooperate with other countries. As the virus spreads across the globe, a large number of leaders have spoken with President Moon Jae-in, seeking the Korean government’s cooperation to secure key supplies such as test kits for the novel strain of coronavirus responsible for the pandemic. Seoul is also said to be considering lifting export regulations on protective masks to help other nations deal with shortages. According to KAIST, its president will stress the importance of international cooperation in dealing with the crisis in today’s hyperconnected society.In his speech, Shin will highlight the importance of “international cooperation based on science and technology” as the only means to bring about a breakthrough in the crisis, and pledge to focus KAIST’s capabilities on finding a “new norm” in the political, social and economic spheres, KAIST said. The remarks will be followed by keynote speeches from leading experts in the fields of vaccine research and health care, as well as representatives of businesses and government organizations. Keynote speakers include International Vaccine Institute Director General Jerome Kim; Arnaud Bernaert, head of global health and health care at the World Economic Forum; and Yong Hong-taek from Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT. Kim’s speech will deal with the establishment of a global cooperation network to speed up the development of vaccines and treatments when faced with a new disease. Bernaert will talk about the World Economic Forum’s newly established COVID Action Platform and about cooperation among nations, businesses and international organizations. According to KAIST, Microsoft’s Higher Education Industry Solutions Director Alexandros Papaspyridis will give a speech titled “There is no turning back: Preparing for the new normal.” In the speech, Papaspyridis will discuss the changes COVID-19 has brought to the education sector across the globe, and the innovations required for the “new normal” after the pandemic. The keynote speeches will be followed by two panel discussions. The first will deal with the impact the pandemic is having on the global economy, and on education systems. Experts taking part in the first discussion are David Dollar and Rebecca Winthrop of the Brookings Institution, Korea Development Institute Director Suh Joong-hae and Ra Young-sun, head of the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training. Winthrop is a co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Universal Education, and Dollar is a senior fellow at the institution. In the second, the roles of health care systems, artificial intelligence and information technology will be discussed. Speakers will include Ryu Wang-shik, CEO of Institute Pasteur Korea, and KAIST artificial intelligence professor Shin Jin-woo. According to KAIST, the forum is the first to deal with international cooperation in the “post-coronavirus era.” The forum will be streamed live on the YouTube channels of KAIST and the state-funded broadcaster Korea TV. The forum will also be streamed live by the local portal operator Naver.
