"Studies have already shown that by irradiating bald skin using red lasers, hair follicles can be stimulated into growing new hair. Unfortunately, though, such laser setups are large, cumbersome and energy-inefficient. With that in mind, scientists have developed a  LED photostimulator.Led by Prof. Keon Jae Lee, scientists from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) created a flexible array of 900 vertical micro-light-emitting diodes (μLEDs). The whole array fits onto a chip that's ""slightly smaller than a postage stamp,"" is just 20 micrometers thick, and can withstand up to 10,000 bending/unbending cycles.Additionally, the μLEDs don't heat up enough to damage human skin, and use one one-thousandth the power per unit area as a traditional phototherapeutic laser.In lab tests, the device was tested on the shaved backs of mice. After 20 days of 15-minute once-daily treatments, the animals regrew their fur significantly faster than shaved mice that received no treatment, or that were getting hair-growth-promoting minoxidil injections. The μLED-array mice also regrew hair over a wider area, and the hairs were considerably longer.It is now hoped that a larger version of the device could someday be used by humans in their own homes on a daily basis, as opposed to their making trips to use laser systems at clinics.A paper on the research was recently published in the journal , in which images of the μLED array can be seen.Source:  via ",Wearable LED device could regrow hair,https://newatlas.com/led-hair-array/56306/
"January 25, 2005  A humanoid robot developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIST) has significantly bridged the gap between Japan's advanced robotic technologies and the rest of the world, once again affirming that Korea will be a major player in the fast-growing robotics industry. Developed in just three years at a fraction of the cost of the world's most advanced humanoid robot, Honda's Asimo, KAIST's robot will be known as Hubo. Hubo is a 150cm tall, 67 kilogram prodigy with a natural walk, voice recognition and synthesis faculties and advanced vision capabilities with both eyes operating independently. Unlike any previous humanoid, Hubo's on-board intelligence is largely supplemented a wireless connection to a powerful external server.The project is headed by Professor Jun-Ho Oh of the Machine Control Laboratoy in the Department of Mechanical Engineeringat KAIST. Professor Jun-Ho Oh gained his Ph.D at Berkeley  in California in the mid-eighties and only assembled the Hubo project team at the beginning of 2002. The first prototype, known as KHR-1, was complete within eight months and was walking within 12 months.The second major version of the robot (KHR-2) was begun in January 2003, and the third revision, (KHR-3) was begun in January 2004, based on the advanced capabilities of KHR-2, but with greatly improved stability. KHR-3 was subsequently renamed  and was shown to the press for the Korean press for the first time in December.Though not yet as advanced as Honda's Asimo, Hubo is catching up fast - developed at a cost of less than 1 billion won (US$1 million), the robot has 41 degrees of freedom, far more than , which cost more than US$300 million to develop over nearly two decades.An in-depth interview with Professor Jun-Ho Oh can be read at the Korean  site (in English).For a wide ranging coverage of robotic industry developments, visit the .",Korea shows its robotics prowess with a rival for Asimo,https://newatlas.com/korea-shows-its-robotics-prowess-with-a-rival-for-asimo/3638/
"Make no mistake, we are in the middle of a profoundly significant revolution: a shift into the age of artificial intelligence. And while the advances from year to year may seem small and piecemeal, when we look back in 10 or 20 years with the benefit of hindsight, these incremental moments will form key planks in the narrative we craft about how our future world came to be.Late last year  the creation of artificial intelligence could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization, ""… or the worst. We just don't know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it.""2018 was a fascinating year for AI. We experienced a variety of milestone moments, such as the first auction of AI art, and a large assortment of exciting developments that perfectly encapsulate Hawking's prophetic lack of certainty regarding humanity's future relationship with artificial intelligence. In 2018 we paved the way for a future where AI could heal us, harm us, or even teach us. Military uses for artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of autonomous weaponry, seem almost inevitable at this stage. We've seen glimpses of development over the past few years but events in 2018 brought the controversial ethical debate into the foreground.In February  the launch of a new facility that joined up the country's primary research university KAIST, with Hanwha Systems, the country's leading defense company. The goal of the collaboration was to, quite literally, work on the development of AI-based military innovations. The announcement was basically the government saying, ""screw it, we know that you know that we are already doing this, so why bother hiding it."" The Future of Life Institute, a coalition of leading AI researchers,  and pledged a major academic boycott of the university. By April the president of KAIST had capitulated, agreeing the university would not develop lethal autonomous weapons.A few months later, the Future of Life institute , getting 160 AI-related companies and organizations, and over 2,400 researchers and engineers to pledge they would not, ""participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons."" It was a landmark moment that will either stifle the development of autonomous military weapons or simply push those working on these technologies back into the shadows.There is absolutely no doubt AI systems can sift through massive troves of data faster than any human. With the growing volume and complexity of medical data, these systems are proving stunningly effective at recognizing patterns that no human would be able to detect. This year has revealed several incredible algorithmic advances that point to a future where AI systems will be able to effectively diagnose, and treat, a person's medical conditions just by looking at their records. suggested an AI algorithm, trained to evaluate a variety of diagnostic data, could be effective at predicting whether a person is at the very earliest stages of cognitive decline, and if they are likely to significantly deteriorate over the following five years. Another system was trained to predict the social outcomes of patients with depression or psychosis, and in early experiments .Other scientists are developing AI systems to crunch through our immense repositories of clinical research to  in already published papers or . It's not hard to see AI assistants in every aspect of medicine soon, from the earliest stages of clinical research, to the bedside of patients offering doctors diagnostic advice.More than any other country in the world, China is racing to integrate AI systems into its entire social ecosystem, and 2018 revealed the populous nation has already started to test an assortment of striking education-enhancing technologies. In May it was revealed that a high school in Eastern China was  designed to analyze the engagement of students in a class room, in real-time. The ""intelligent classroom behavior management system"" scans the room every 30 seconds logging both the behavior of the students and their facial expressions.An even more provocative story came out of China around the same time, revealing the existence of a  that is being used to automatically grade student essays. It's currently estimated that 60,000 schools are testing the technology, and it can reportedly offer the same grade as a human marker up to 92 percent of the time. One researcher working on the project frighteningly said, ""It has evolved continuously and become so complex, we no longer know for sure what it was thinking and how it made a judgment."" has been quietly bubbling away , with many engineers and computer scientists working on ways to . However, 2018 presented a major milestone with an put up for auction at a major auction house for the very first time. Expected to sell for between US$7,000 and $10,000, the world was stunned when bidding pushed the final sale price up to an astounding $432,500.The artwork itself quickly became mired in controversy with many in the AI world suggesting it was produced by algorithms previously developed by other scientists. This raised entirely new questions over what constitutes originality when a work of art is produced by an algorithm. Can you own the creative output of an algorithm? Whether this was good art, or even art in any sense of the word, is a philosophical argument sure to be debated for years to come, but what we can be sure of is that this AI-generated work will not be the last machine-made portrait to hit the high-end art market.IBM's Watson supercomputer was given 15 years' worth of TV ads that won Cannes Lions International awards for creativity, alongside human emotional response data and company brand guidelines. The goal was to get Watson to spit out a script for a luxury car advertisement. , with the aid of an Oscar-winning filmmaker, and to be honest, it turned out to be one of the most coherent AI-generated pieces of media we've seen to date (skip to 8:30 in the video below to watch the ad).Advertising, more than music, movies, art or entertainment, is the perfect incubation bed for this kind of technology. It's already massively data-driven, for one, and it's one of the few forms of ""creative"" expression directly designed to produce a measurable result in the decision making of its audience. So, while we've seen less than stellar attempts from AI in the past to make a mark in the world of film and television, it seems mastering TV ads is currently where the technology is at.In absolute contrast to the Lexus advertisement,  is a blurry, incoherent, and entirely bonkers short film that also represents a truly stunning achievement in AI artistic creation. Instead of just penning the screenplay for a film or ad, the goal was to let an AI system generate an entire film, including cutting together the whole thing by face-swapping human actors onto old public domain films.The duo behind this crazy project were responsible for another incredible AI production . This time the AI system took the green-screened  actors, chewed up a massive volume of public domain movies, and then created a . The result is not exactly refined but it offers a great indication of what could be done in a decade or two once this kind of technology improves.Shakespearean sonnets are often held up as a pinnacle of English poetic prose, creating rhythmic rhyming patterns within a strict set of parameters. So, of course, a team of researchers set out to create  that could rival those of The Bard.The system was trained on 2,600 sonnets and, while the final results were convincing enough to fool regular laypeople, a serious English literature professor was not so easily fooled, suggesting the AI output could be easily identified from human writing due to its lower emotional impact. Below are two sonnet quatrains, one written by Shakespeare and the other by AI. Can you tell the difference? (The answer is at the end of this article.)Voice assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, are evolving pretty quickly, but this year Google inadvertently sparked an ethical debate by presenting a . The system interacts with Google Assistant, and can essentially engage in simple conversational tasks via phone calls to businesses, such as scheduling a hair salon appointment, or making a reservation at a restaurant.The big hallmark of Google Duplex is the system's ability to conduct natural sounding conversations. The system is programmed to have a quick response time and incorporate what Google refers to as ""speech disfluencies"" to sound more natural. This includes subtly calibrated ""hmm""s and ""uh""s to sound like a real person, and not the rigid mechanical computer voices we are generally used to.Instead of admiration, the general public's response was shock and concern. People debated whether it was ethical for an AI system to pretend to be human, or whether there should be rules stipulating these new systems identify themselves as artificial when communicating with a human. Natural voice interactions with computers were, until this year, just an abstract sci-fi concept depicted in movies where people converse with AI systems such as HAL in . In 2018, for the first time, we had to grapple with the actual reality of this development and ask ourselves what happens when we can't tell if it is a human or an AI on the other end of the line.",From weapons to works of art: The year in artificial intelligence,https://newatlas.com/year-highlights-artificial-intelligence-ai-2018-best-of/57606/
"A lot has been made of the dangers of drones mixing with other aircraft, but one team of engineers is exploring how they can help guard planes from threats rather than present new ones. The work centers on a new algorithm developed specifically to allow a drone to shepherd birds away from flight paths like robotic aerial sheepdogs, and the early results suggest that this could prove an effective way to cut costs and improve safety.Collisions between planes and birds create all sorts of problems, the obvious danger and harm they cause to animal life aside. They mostly strike the aircraft in the engine or windows of the cockpit, and when they do, the pilot is forced to land at the nearest airport to check for damage. This means passengers need to be booked on other flights, which comes at a huge cost. In the UK alone, there were 1,835 confirmed bird strikes in 2016. In North America, bird strikes cost airlines an estimated US$500 million a year.Existing solutions include deploying trained falcons, using recordings of predatory birds, or flying a human-controlled drone into the area to scare the birds away. Now scientists at Imperial College London, together with researchers from Caltech and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), may have come up with a better way.The effort began with mathematical modeling of the way flocks of birds behave. This involved the dynamics of how the flocks build, how they are maintained, how they respond to threats at their edges and then how that threat is communicated throughout the flock. Based on this modeling, the team then built a herding algorithm that programs flight paths for a drone, specifically laid out to drive birds away from a designated airspace. It does this both without harming the flock and without causing it to disperse. The algorithm was put to the test on flocks of loons and egrets, with the herding drone carrying out a series of maneuvers around the flock to push them away from the protected airspace, while other drones hovered above to film the action for the team's observations. The team found the approach worked well, successfully shepherding flocks of different sizes away as desired. The researchers had expected that the larger the flock, the more difficult it would be to herd, and they were right. The next steps involve looking at how multiple drones can both be used to shepherd larger flocks, and multiple flocks at the same time. ""These are exciting findings,"" said Dr Aditya Paranjape from Imperial College London's Department of Aeronautics. ""We hope that our study will give airport authorities the incentive to seek and develop autonomous drone-based solutions.""The research was published in the journal while the video below provides and overview of the technology.Source:  ",Flying sheepdogs: Herding birds away from planes with autonomous drones,https://newatlas.com/flying-sheepdogs-drones-planes-birds/55846/
"If you build a soft, conformable robot body but then put rigid, unyielding actuators inside of it, you're kind of defeating the whole purpose of the thing. With that in mind, Korean scientists have created pliable artificial muscles for use in soft robotics.Led by Prof. Il-Kwon Oh, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) started with one particular type of a two-dimensional, highly electrically-conductive material known as .When it was initially applied to one side of a thin strip of flexible polymer, it caused that strip to bend when an electrical current was applied. Unfortunately, though, because the MXene itself isn't very flexible, bits of it flaked off of the polymer every time it bent.To remedy that problem, the scientists utilized an ""ionic crosslinking"" process to bond the MXene  the polymer. Strips of the resulting composite material bend quickly in response to even relatively low voltage, staying intact and maintaining their strength and conductivity after more than five hours of continuous movement.So far, the technology has been demonstrated in the form of a narcissus-flower-like brooch that opens its petals in response to an electrical current, and robotic butterflies (shown in the video below) that move their wings up and down.""Wearable robotics and kinetic art demonstrate how robotic muscles can have fun and beautiful applications,"" says Oh. ""It also shows the enormous potential for small, artificial muscles for a variety of uses, such as haptic feedback systems and active biomedical devices.""A paper on the research was recently published in the journal .Source: ","Thin-strip ""muscles"" may find use in soft n' squishy robots",https://newatlas.com/artificial-muscles-soft-robotics/
"The Sun is a great source of energy, but of course those rays can be damaging as well. Engineers in Korea have now developed a new way to make perovskite solar cells to protect them from the elements without reducing their efficiency.Perovskite materials are effective at absorbing energy from sunlight, thanks to their crystal structure. They can be modified to absorb more wavelengths of light, making them more efficient. Unfortunately this is also their undoing, making the material more vulnerable to long exposure to heat, moisture, oxygen and light. And that’s a real problem, considering these are made to sit in the Sun all day.So a team of researchers, from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul National University and Sejong University set out to modify the material to improve its hardiness.To do so, the team carefully mixed in molecules made of phenethylammonium and arranged in two-dimensional layers, inside the perovskite. This boosted both the efficiency and durability of solar cells, including ones made with just perovskite and others where perovskite was laid on top of a silicon layer.The researchers report that their all-perovskite solar cell reached a peak conversion efficiency of 20.7 percent, and retained 80 percent of that after 1,000 hours of continuous light. When paired with silicon, the efficiency rose to 26.7 percent – not far off the  – and had a similar durability.“We developed a high-quality wide bandgap perovskite material and, in combination with silicon solar cells, achieved world-class perovskite-silicon tandem cells,” says Byungha Shin, lead researcher on the study. “Our ultimate goal is to develop ultra-high-efficiency tandem solar cells that contribute to the increase of shared solar energy among all energy sources.”The team says that it plans on pushing the limits of that efficiency, hoping to break past the 30-percent point that’s eluded engineers for years – but remains theoretically possible.The research was published in the journal .Source: ",2D additives make perovskite solar cells more durable in the Sun,https://newatlas.com/energy/perovskite-solar-cells-durable-efficient/
"Corals serve as a host to algae, which in turn produces sugars that the corals consume. Now, though, scientists have created 3D-printed coral that's even more algae-friendly than its natural equivalent – it could help address the problem of coral bleaching, and provide a source of biofuel.The biocompatible synthetic coral was produced via a collaboration between researchers at Cambridge University and the University of California San Diego. They utilized a light-based rapid bioprinting technique, that can produce objects at micrometer-scale resolution within a matter of minutes.Each piece of the printed coral incorporates a skeleton that supports what's described as ""coral-like tissue."" The skeleton is made of a biocompatible polymer gel known as PEGDA, to which cellulose nanocrystals have been added. The tissue, meanwhile, consists of a gelatin-based polymer hydrogel by the name of GelMA, which is combined with living algae cells and more of the cellulose nanocrystals.Thanks to those crystals, along with cup-like shapes and cylindrical structures in the skeleton, the 3D-printed coral is much better than the real thing at absorbing light and directing it to the algae. In fact, when a commercial strain of microalgae called  was incorporated into the material, that algae grew 100 times more densely than it did on natural coral in standard liquid growth mediums.It is now hoped that once developed further, the technology could be utilized in compact, more efficient bioreactors that grow algae for use in biofuels. Additionally, it may help scientists to develop new techniques for mitigating coral bleaching, by better understanding the relationship between corals and their life-giving algae – in bleaching events, that algae is expelled by the coral.The research is described in a paper that was recently published in the journal .And as a side note, this isn't the first 3D-printed coral we've seen. Last year, Israeli scientists created  that reef fish appeared to prefer over the genuine article.Sources: , ",Bioprinted coral outdoes the real thing at growing algae,https://newatlas.com/science/3d-printed-coral-growing-algae/
"While there are already systems that allow smartphones to identify objects by photographing them, such technology doesn't work well in dim light – plus, not everyone wants to bother taking photos. A new system, however, can identify objects simply by knocking a smartphone against them.Developed by scientists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), the tech is appropriately enough known as Knocker.It's initially ""trained"" on sample objects, using the phone's existing microphone, gyroscope and accelerometer to learn the specific sounds and vibrations that occur when the phone makes hard contact with each item. When the phone is subsequently knocked against something, it compares that object's sound and vibrations to those that it's learned, looking for a match. If a match is found, then the object is identified.Knocker has already been trained to recognize 23 commonly-used items such as laptop computers, bicycles, books, and water bottles. In its current state of development, it has an identification accuracy rate of 83 percent when used in noisy settings such as roadsides or busy cafes, although that number climbs to 98 percent in quiet locations.Of course, most potential users will already know what the objects that they regularly use . Instead, it is envisioned that Knocker could be utilized for applications such as ordering new bottled water when the phone is knocked against an empty bottle, noting a user's parking location when the phone is knocked against their locked bike, or turning the lights off when knocked against a bed's headboard.""This new technology does not require any specialized sensor or hardware,"" says project leader, Prof. Sung-Ju Lee. ""It simply uses the built-in sensors on smartphones and takes advantage of the power of machine learning. It’s a software solution that everyday smartphone users could immediately benefit from.""More possible uses for the technology are demonstrated in the following video.Source: ",Smartphone tech recognizes objects by being knocked against them,https://newatlas.com/good-thinking/knocker-smartphone-object-recognition/
"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a promising solid state, thin-film lithium-ion battery that claims the highest energy density ever achieved for a flexible battery. The new design, which showed for the first time that high-performance thin films can be used for flexible batteries, may be commercialized as early as next year.Lithium-ion batteries are a strong candidate for powering the flexible electronics of the future. A high-performance  would be a giant step toward fully-fledged flexible electronics systems and would open the door to flexible e-paper, wearable devices, and better piezoelectric systems that harvest energy from mechanical forces.Research is progressing, but seems to have hit an invisible – though very real – performance wall. This is because most designs employ either low-performance flexible organic materials, or  that take up too much space and decrease the battery's power density. In addition, the cathodes have to be treated at high temperatures to improve performance, but this can't be done effectively on substrates made of flexible polymers.The new approach developed at KAIST uses high energy density inorganic thin films that can be treated at high temperatures, resulting in the highest-performance flexible lithium-ion batteries yet. ""There is no performance difference in energy density, capacity, and cycle life between our flexible battery and bulk batteries,"" Prof. Keon Jae Lee, who led the research efforts, told Gizmag. ""On the contrary, performance is improved by about 10 percent because of the stress release effect.""The batteries are built by sequentially depositing several layers – a current collector, a cathode, an electrolyte, an anode, and a protective layer – on a brittle substrate made of mica. Then, the mica is manually delaminated using adhesive tape, and the battery is enclosed between two polymer sheets to improve mechanical resistance.Bending the battery affects performance, but not to disastrous levels. With the battery constantly bent at a radius of sixteen millimeters (about the same curvature of a fifty-cent coin) the discharge capacity drops by about seven percent after 100 charge-discharge cycles, compared to a three percent drop when the battery is not bent. Voltage was shown to remain almost constant, dropping by a very modest 0.02 V after the battery was bent and released 20,000 times.""The technology for commercializing this battery could come in a relatively short time, about a year,"" says Prof. Lee. But first, the researchers need to find a better, automated way to delaminate the mica substrate – the manual method, involving adhesive tape, is very unpractical and can take up to ten minutes per battery.""We are investigating a laser lift-off [delamination] process to facilitate mass production of large area flexible lithium-ion batteriesr"" says Lee. ""Its feasibility is already proven and will be reported in a later paper.""The team is also interested in stacking the structures on top of each other to improve charge density.A paper describing the battery was recently published on the journal .

" is a parasitic insect that spends much of its life cycle within the body of a host paper wasp, but it's also known for something else – its unusual eye structure. By copying that structure, scientists have created an ultra-slim camera that could allow for the manufacturing of thinner-than-ever smartphones or other imaging devices.Developed by a team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), the prototype camera is just 1.4 mm thick and has a diameter of 3.4 mm. Instead of the usual single stack of lens elements, it consists of an array of microprisms, every one of them sitting above a corresponding microlens. Each of these prism/lens combos individually channels light to a single underlying CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor. All of these light channels are separated from one another by a light-absorbing material which reduces ""optical crosstalk"" – this is an undesirable phenomenon in which the light signal from one channel interferes with the signal of an adjacent channel.Ultimately, each prism/lens captures a partial image of the subject, from a slightly different perspective. These partials are digitally combined to form a single wide-angle high-resolution shot of the entire subject.""We have proposed a novel method of fabricating an ultrathin camera,"" says lead scientist Prof.  Ki-Hun Jeong.

"This week DARPA kicks off a  called the Subterranean Challenge, where hordes of robots are unleashed into caves and tunnels to test how well they can autonomously navigate these environments. One team, headed up by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), is entering a crew of bots that could inform future designs of spacefaring robots that explore caves and lava tubes on other planets and moons.The DARPA Subterranean Challenge was designed to help plug an apparent gap in the ability of robots and autonomous systems to navigate underground environments. That includes natural cave networks, which have irregular terrain and both constrained and large caverns; artificial tunnel systems with long passages, vertical shafts and multiple levels; and urban underground environments like subway systems, which can have complex layouts over multiple stories.To help stimulate innovation in this area, DARPA is putting out the call to teams of engineers and scientists at institutions and companies all over the world. There's over US$5 million in prize money up for grabs for the teams that can successfully map these environments, avoid the hazards and retrieve hidden items as proof.The first test, running this week, is the Tunnel Circuit. In this, teams must map old mining tunnels and find certain objects hidden inside, such as phones and heated mannequins. No humans are allowed in the tunnels of course – teams have to send in robots of their own design to do the dirty work for them. The winner is the team that marks the locations of the most objects, accurate to within 5 m (16.4 ft).Of course with DARPA at the helm, the most promising technologies from the competition will most likely be put to work in defense scenarios, but the organization also says that first responders could benefit, sending robots into potentially hazardous underground environments to, for example, search for survivors of disasters or locate gas leaks.But not all the robots will have applications here on Earth. Made up of 60 members from JPL, Caltech, MIT and KAIST, the Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Resilient Robots Systems (CoSTAR) team is entering the contest in order to get some practice for a fleet of robots that could one day search for signs of life underground on other worlds.The CoSTAR team is entering a fleet of robots with different strengths into the Challenge. In the Tunnel Circuit, wheeled rovers and robots with tank-like treads designed to handle the rugged terrain will crawl across the ground. The tank-like robot can even rotate its flipper-shaped treads to stand upright. These will be assisted by drones flying overhead, encased in protective shells to withstand bumping into walls.The robots will be equipped with a suite of sensors including cameras, lidar and inertial measurement units (IMU), and will communicate with each other to map out the environments as completely as possible.For future tests in this ongoing challenge, the CoSTAR team plans to use a robot called Drivocopter, which can both drive along the ground and fly up along cave walls and through gaps in the ceiling.The ultimate goal for the team is to apply the lessons learnt in this challenge to robots designed to explore similar environments on the Moon, Mars and other worlds. These underground environments are among the most promising places to look for traces of extraterrestrial life, either still living or long dead.""The big question for NASA is: Is there life beyond Earth?"" says Ali Agha, principal investigator of the CoSTAR team. ""One of the main places to find answers to that question is subsurface environments because they are some of the most pristine locations, shielded from ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays. If there is life in the solar system, these are the most likely places to harbor it.""The Tunnel Circuit of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge will run from August 15 to 22, and involve 11 teams. After that, the Urban Circuit will follow in February 2020, then the Cave Circuit in August 2020 and the Systems Final a full year after that.Check out the CoSTAR team's robots in action in the video below.Sources: , , ",Robots compete in DARPA's Subterranean Challenge to prep for alien life hunt,https://newatlas.com/jpl-darpa-challenge-underground-robots-moon-mars/61041/
"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), have developed a wireless charging system that can charge around 40 smart phones at a time, from a distance of 5 meters (16 ft). While we've examined numerous , even one that transmits power to up to , KAIST's prototype can power multiple devices within its range. It can deliver enough electrical juice, the scientists claim, to power many larger devices like fans, TVs and computers, simultaneously.Called the Dipole Coil Resonant System (DCRS), the technology uses magnetic fields to transfer energy and is based on the  (CMRS) introduced by MIT researchers in 2007. The design of the DCRS however, addresses a number of fundamental issues that prevented the commercialization of the CMRS, such as a complex coil structure requiring four coils, a bulky size factor and low transfer efficiency.The DCRS' coil structure consists of two magnetic dipole coils. The primary coil induces the magnetic field and the secondary coil receives electrical energy. Compact in size and scalable, the system is capable of delivering up to 209 W of power at 20 kHz.""With DCRS,"" says Chun T.

"As we continue to explore other planets, we're going to want to know not only what's on their surface, but also what's underneath it. That's where the Mole-bot comes in – it's a robot that autonomously tunnels its way through the ground.Developed at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), the Mole-bot is inspired by both the European mole and the African mole-rat. The latter excavates tunnels by biting into the earth with its strong incisor teeth, while the former uses its powerful forelimbs to push dislodged soil back behind itself.Instead of mole-rat-like teeth, the Mole-bot has a sort of propeller-like expandable drill in front. As this whirls around and grinds its way into the soil, its folding serrated blades extend outwards to dig a tunnel that's wider than the robot's cylindrical body. Next, instead of forelimbs, the bot uses two extendable hinged metal flanges located on either side of the drill to push the loose soil back past its front end.The drill and the flanges operate alternately, so that they don't get in one another's way.Three caterpillar-like tracks in the rear push the Mole-bot forward, plus a pivoting mechanical ""waist"" in its midsection allows it to change direction while tunnelling. It's able to orient itself utilizing 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology, which continuously tracks the robot's location relative to the Earth's magnetic field.Along with its use on other planets, the Mole-bot might also be utilized in the mining industry. As compared to existing drilling systems, it is claimed to be cheaper, less labor-intensive and more eco-friendly, as it doesn't require mud compounds in order to clear debris. The current prototype, which is the third version of the robot, measures 84 cm long by 25 cm wide (33 by 9.8 in) and weighs 26 kg (57 lb).""We look forward to a more efficient resource exploration with this type of drilling robot,"" says the lead scientist, Prof. Hyun Myung.

"Hooking our brains up to machines could indeed merge human and artificial intelligence, as envisioned by Elon Musk's Neuralink, and the like. But the more immediate benefits are likely to come in the form of new forms of treatment for brain diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Scientists have put forward another promising experimental device built for these kinds of tasks, which can be loaded up with different cartridges depending on the treatment needed and triggered remotely with a smartphone.The device was developed by scientists at the KAIST research university in South Korea, together with colleagues at the University of Colorado. It promises similar functionality to a  we looked at back in 2015 from the Washington University in St Louis, which used incredibly thin microfluid channels and LED arrays to carry drugs and shine light on brain cells with high precision. The notion of using light to treat certain conditions has gained some serious momentum of late. Known as optogenetics, the therapy stems from the ability to alter the behavior of certain brain cells due to proteins within them that are sensitive to light. It has shown promise as a way of treating ,  and , to name a few examples.In addition to minuscule LED lights, these ultra-fine probes, which are around the same thickness as a human hair, would also allow for the delivery of drugs to highly targeted areas through tiny channels. But one typical shortcoming of these devices is that the medication will inevitably run dry.In conceiving this new device, the researchers sought to overcome this by designing a plug-and-play system that uses replaceable cartridges for a continuous supply. In this way, when a supply of drugs is exhausted a new cartridge can simply be loaded up to allow treatments to potentially last for months at a time.All of that is a lot further down the track, with the scientists initially hoping to use the technology to manipulate neural circuitry in animals as a way of studying brain disorders. To that end, they tested out the device by implanting it into the brains of mice over a four-week period. This also allowed the team to test out the control method, consisting of a smartphone app and Bluetooth connection. This could even allow neuroscientists to dictate drug doses and combinations with light therapy from remote locations.""This novel device is the fruit of advanced electronics design and powerful micro and nanoscale engineering,"" explained Professor Jae-Woong Jeong from KAIST's School of Electrical Engineering.

"Ahead of a major United Nations meeting to address the growing issues surrounding lethal autonomous weapons, a team of leading AI and robotics researchers has called for a boycott of a South Korean university that recently announced the opening of an AI weapons lab., KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), announced the opening of a new facility called the Research Center for the Convergence of National Defense and Artificial Intelligence. The announcement revealed the new research facility would investigate a variety of AI-based military systems, including autonomous undersea vehicles and ""AI-based command and decision systems.""The announcement was received with great concern by many in the artificial intelligence research community and a recently revealed open letter, signed by over 50 researchers from around the globe, is calling for a boycott of all academic collaborations with KAIST over the matter. ""At a time when the United Nations is discussing how to contain the threat posed to international security by autonomous weapons, it is regrettable that a prestigious institution like KAIST looks to accelerate the arms race to develop such weapons,"" the letter states.""We therefore publicly declare that we will boycott all collaborations with any part of KAIST until such time as the President of KAIST provides assurances, which we have sought but not received, that the Center will not develop autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control. We will, for example, not visit KAIST, host visitors from KAIST, or contribute to any research project involving KAIST.""The boycott has been organized by Toby Walsh, an artificial intelligence researcher from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who has been prominent in calling for regulations into the development of autonomous weapons. Walsh previously masterminded major open letters in  and  calling for the banning of weaponized artificial intelligence. ""Back in 2015, we warned of an arms race in autonomous weapons,"" says Walsh. ""That arms race has begun. We can see prototypes of autonomous weapons under development today by many nations including the US, China, Russia and the UK.""KAIST president Sung-Chul Shin has responded to the threatened academic boycott by  denying the institution is working on lethal autonomous weapons systems or ""killer robots.""""The centre aims to develop algorithms on efficient logistical systems, unmanned navigation [and an] aviation training system,"" . ""KAIST will be responsible for educating the researchers and providing consultation. As an academic institution, we value human rights and ethical standards to a very high degree. KAIST will not conduct any research activities counter to human dignity, including autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control.""Curiously, the KAIST website has removed the original announcement, published in late February, describing the opening of the new research centre.

"A study from researchers at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is providing new insights into a cellular energy pathway that has been linked to longer lifespan. The research, conducted in human cells and roundworms, raises the prospect of anti-aging therapeutics that can extend lifespan by activating this pathway.AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is an enzyme that acts as a metabolic master switch. It has been described as a “” protein, conferring broad beneficial health effects, from improving cardiovascular health to extending lifespan. It is activated in response to low cellular energy levels, as is often seen during exercise or periods of caloric restriction.An increasing volume of study has found  leads to notable increases in lifespan, prompting a surge in research investigating this enzyme.The new KAIST study focused on this pathway in a tiny roundworm, , often used by researchers as a model to investigate lifespan. The researchers discovered an enzyme called VRK-1 works in tandem with AMPK to regulate cellular energy processes.Boosting VRK-1 activity in the roundworms extended the organism’s lifespan by stimulating AMPK activity, and inhibiting the enzyme reduced its lifespan. Moving to laboratory cell tests the researchers verified this VRK-1 to AMPK mechanism does seem to occur in human cells, suggesting it is possible the lifespan-extending results may be replicated in human subjects.“This raises the intriguing possibility that VRK-1 also functions as a factor in governing human longevity, and so perhaps we can start developing longevity-promoting drugs that alter the activity of VRK-1,” explains Seung-Jae V. Lee, who lead the new research.It is still extraordinarily early days for the research, and the next steps will be to explore the effects of modulating VRK-1 activity in more complex animal models such as rodents. Lee says the success in replicating this VRK-1 to AMPK mechanism in human cells suggests the pathway may be relevant in a number of complex organisms, but it is still unclear how this could be harnessed for therapeutic outcomes.The new study was published in the journal .Source: ",Anti-aging enzyme discovery raises prospect of lifespan extension,https://newatlas.com/science/anti-aging-enzyme-lifespan-extension-ampk-kaist/
"With our current technology, it would take a conventional spacecraft over 18,000 years to reach the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, but calculations indicate a nano-spacecraft made from a silicon chip and traveling at one fifth the speed of light could make the journey in just 20 years. The problem is, such a ""space-chip"" wouldn't survive the intense radiation and temperature swings of deep space, so a team at NASA and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) are developing a method for helping the chip heal itself on the fly.Currently, there are three ways to maximize the survival of a chip on an interstellar journey: the most obvious is to add a metal shield to keep radiation out, but that can be bulky and defeats the purpose of the small, light craft. Alternatively, astronomers could choose a path for the spacecraft that minimizes its exposure to radiation, but that limits where it can travel, increases mission times and doesn't account for any unexpected hazards.The third method, which was the focus of the study, is ""radiation-aware circuit design."" Rather than the standard fin field-effect transistor (), the team worked with a ""gate-all-around"" nanowire transistor () previously developed by KAIST. In these circuits, the gate surrounds the nanowire and permits or prevents the flow of electrons through it. Dual contact pads allow current to flow through the gate and the channel it surrounds, heating it to over 900° C (1,652° F) in under 10 nanoseconds, and that heat has been shown to fix performance degradation caused by radiation, stress and age.This system of heating to invoke self-healing was tested in three different components critical for a silicon-chip spacecraft: a microprocessor, DRAM memory and a flash memory drive for storage. On all three counts, the system worked to extend the device's lifetime, and repeatedly deal with any defects caused by radiation. The flash memory could be repaired 10,000 times, and for the DRAM, that process could be repeated a whopping 10 times over. Coupled with GAA FET's baked-in advantages of hardiness against cosmic rays and allowing for much smaller circuits, the researchers conclude that the technology opens up the opportunity for sustainable nano-spacecraft to make long-distance space voyages.The team presented their study at the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in San Francisco last week.Source: KAIST () via ",Self-healing nano-spacecraft could reach Alpha Centauri in 20 years,https://newatlas.com/self-healing-nano-spacecraft-nasa-kaist/46890/
"While the most powerful robots are still , millions of years of evolution has made animals masters of tricky terrain. To take advantage of this scientists are exploring ways to augment living animals with robotic systems, and now a team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has used a ""parasitic robot"" to control the movements of a live turtle by feeding it treats., , and  have all gotten the cyborg treatment in the past, allowing scientists to take advantage of their natural talents. After all, why build a drone from scratch that can hover and zip around at high speeds when a dragonfly can already do just that? By the same logic, a turtle is already adept at crawling over rocky ground and swimming, so it's more straight forward to just build a system to control the animals.A few months ago, the KAIST team was  with having a human user send instructions to steer the turtle just by thinking ""left"" or ""right,"" but this new iteration instead allows the creatures to autonomously move towards a target. It makes use of what the team calls a ""parasitic robot"" attached to the turtle's shell and programmed to move to a given waypoint. Turtles naturally move towards sources of light, so to direct the animal the robot flashes an LED in front of its face. When the turtle moves in the right direction, the robot reinforces the behavior by feeding it a little treat. After a training period of five weeks, the team says the dynamic duo of robot and turtle were able to move around a water tank to reach changing waypoints with ease. In future, other animals like mice, birds and fish could be fitted with similar systems for a range of exploration and reconnaissance missions. ""This hybrid animal-robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution to the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields, and could also act as a useful interaction system for the behavioral sciences,"" says Dae-Gun Kim, first author of the study.The research was published in the .

"Butterfly wing material is somewhat like , in that they’re both animal-produced substances which scientists are very interested in copying. In the case of butterfly wings, it’s their ability to brilliantly reflect light in a variety of iridescent colors that could prove particularly useful to humans. Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) are reporting success in replicating the reflective properties of the insects’ wings, using tiny glass beads.Prof. Shin Jung Hoon led the team, which set out to copy the wings of the morpho butterfly. According to the researchers, the secret to the morpho’s striking wings is that their reflective microstructure is at once ordered and chaotic. Analyzed at the 100-nanometer level, the structure is in disarray. Zoom out to the 1-micrometer level, however, and it becomes uniform.The scientists replicated this arrangement by first randomly aligning glass beads of various sizes, although all of them measured approximately a few hundred nanometers across. That took care of the chaotic structure. Then, they used a semiconductor deposition process to deposit a thin film over top of the beads. This made the structure appear ordered when viewed as a whole. They sealed the resulting film in thin clear plastic, to protect it and give it more structure.The finished product was said to produce a better quality and brightness of reflected light than the butterfly wings themselves. Additionally, the color of the film changes less than that of the wings, when viewed from different angles.Down the road, the technology could find use in anti-counterfeit currency, ultra-bright mobile device displays, sensors, or even the fashion industry. KAIST isn’t the first institution to copy the reflective qualities of butterfly wings, however. A joint  team has had success, as has a group from the  – although using different techniques.Source: ",Glass beads used to mimic butterfly wings,https://newatlas.com/glass-bead-butterfly-wings/22483/
"The  (DRC) has come to a close with South Korea's Team KAIST and its DRC-HUBO robot taking first prize in the US$3.5 million competition. The US Department of Defense's project to develop robots that can help responders in disaster areas saw KAIST beat 23 other teams from around the world in front of a crowd of 10,000 people.On Saturday, as on the , the action involved robots running a series of simultaneous heats where they negotiated a course while executing a series of eight tasks that simulated working in a disaster area. The tasks included driving a car, opening a door, operating a valve, and climbing a flight of stairs. To prevent the teams from pre-programming the robots to run the course, a surprise task was included, which on the final day of the two-day competition required the robots to remove an electrical plug from a socket and set it in a different socket.Under intense Californian sunshine, the final day of the Challenge saw the competition upped a notch. Since damage to the robots that would put them out of the running was no longer a factor, the teams took more chances and robots fell more often.Team Aist Nedo performed very well until the debris challenge, but just when the anime-styled robot HRP2+ stepped off the debris field for a point, it toppled onto cinder blocks, bursting open its torso and spewing components.Another challenger that was initially doing well was Team Robotis' Thormang 2 ... until it fell unexpectedly and lost its head while tackling the surprise task. The robot had unplugged a wire and was sorting out how to plug it into the other socket, then quietly toppled over and hit its head on the wall, knocking it loose.Falling over was a common occurrence with so many bipedal robots competing, and some were even sporting foam shoulder pads to protect their delicate arm mechanisms. Many times the falls would happen while the robots were navigating the debris field or climbing the stairs, but sometimes it would be an almost surreal event, like when Lockheed Team Trooper's Leo opened the door, paused, then calmly fell to the ground as if it had decided to have a quick nap.It's interesting to note that the robots were required to stand up on their own or face a ten minute penalty, but for all the falling, only Tartan Rescue's Chimp managed to get back to its feet on the first day and none did so on the second. Behind the wheel, team Vigir's eponymous robot did its own take on self-driving cars when it crashed its Polaris two-seater into a traffic barrier during the driving challenge. Crash-test robots weren't the only spectacle either – between the heats, as the next robots were wheeled out and prepared, Boston Dynamic's  gamboled on the track in an impressive and alarmingly lifelike display of robotic agility. By the afternoon, teams that had finished the competition were doing post mortems back in the cavernous ""garage,"" where many of them had been living 24 hours a day throughout the Challenge. Robots were in various states of repair. Some were back in tethers and taking steps under the watchful eye of engineers like patients in an accident ward, some were almost completely disassembled, some seemed abandoned by their makers, and others were posed as either educational or humorous exhibits. The last few teams, the heavy hitters with high point scores, were still preparing with last minute test runs and system checks.The general atmosphere was for the most part one of elation, given the huge task the teams faced to make it to the competition in the first place. This was a sentiment shared by both high-scoring teams and those whose robots never got further than the first task – this was a matter of building robots that were like nothing seen before, and just getting them to the point where they could attempt the DARPA course was a major achievement.Meanwhile the competition wound down to its conclusion, which while not exactly suspenseful, was certainly appreciated by the large crowd.Team WPI-CMU's Warner was a crowd pleaser and looked like it would have a very good second day until the hole cutting task. The robot managed to pick up and activate two cordless drills only to drop both, forcing it to abandon the task.This sort of difficulty is an illustration of the nature of the challenge. With the operators for each team confined to a building a quarter of a mile away and linked to their robot by a deliberately degraded communications system, they had to deal with significant time lags a very limited ability to control the machine. Therefore, the robots had to be built with a high degree of autonomy, which the team engineers told us was the greatest part of the challenge. They had to build software that told the robot to carry out whole tasks and decide for itself how to do them. Precise teleoperation simply wasn't an option.This was obvious when Team Robosimian took to the field. The robot, which resembles a cross between a spider and an ape, recovered neatly from a drill problem, but flubbed the surprise task when it lost its gap on the plug and backed away until it dropped it. Watched the plug slowly slide out of the robot’s open claw must have been agonizing for the operators when a simple command to close it would have saved the day.It was clear by the last round that first prize would go to Team KAIST's DRC-HUBO robot and that the likely challengers weren't going to deliver an upset. DRC-HUBO is the latest of the ""HUmanoid roBOt (HUBO) robots developed by the  in collaboration with the Rainbow Company since 2002. DRC-HUBO gains some of its advantage from  its unique leg design. Instead of just walking, it can also transform into a rolling mode. When it kneels, the lower limbs turn into a stable platform with wheels on the ankles and knees to propel it at relatively high speed. With its modified humanoid hybrid design and lightweight aluminum construction, KAIST says that it improves on previous versions, is more powerful, has stronger hands, and is programed with a new walking algorithm. In addition, all motors are equipped with cooling fans.The final scores for the 2015 DRC Final saw Team KAIST taking the US$2 million first prize with 8 points and a time of 44:28. Second was Team IHMC Robotics's Running Man robot with 8 points and a time of 50:26.

"Researchers at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a new indoor positioning system that makes it possible to build a Wi-Fi radio map that does not require GPS signals. It's claimed to be an improvement on , that rely on both GPS and Wi-Fi signals.The system consists of a set of Wi-Fi LAN signals captured by a mobile device, and the measurements of received Wi-Fi signal strengths (RSSs) from access points surrounding the device. The Wi-Fi radio map shows the RSSs of Wi-Fi access points at different locations in a given environment, so each ""Wi-Fi fingerprint"" on the radio map is linked to data on location.For their research, the KAIST team collected fingerprints from users' smartphones every 30 minutes for a week, through modules embedded in mobile platforms, utilities or applications. After that, they analyzed the characteristics of the collected fingerprints based on the users’ home and office addresses as location references. Then they classified the fingerprints collected from the phones according to one of those two locations.Using Google’s geocoding, Prof. Dong-Soo Han converted each home and office address into geographic coordinates to obtain the location of the collected fingerprints. The Wi-Fi radio map has both the fingerprints and coordinates, whereby the location of the phones can be identified or tracked.In order to test the method, the research team collected 7,000 Wi-Fi fingerprints at 400 access points in each of four selected areas in Korea. They were careful to choose a mix of commercial and residential locations to collect data for the Wi-Fi radio map. The researchers realized that the more data they collected, the more accurately they could determine location. With a collection rate of 50 percent (that is, with every other house or office in the area covered), the margin of error was not more than 10 meters (32.8 ft).The KAIST researchers want a non-GPS alternative because GPS signals do not work well in indoor spaces or between high-rise buildings, as they lose two-thirds of their accuracy in vertical configurations – they need a clear view of the sky to communicate with satellites.The researchers still need to deal with privacy protection issues before launching the method commercially, but they believe that once the address-based radio map is fully developed for commercial use, it will be useful for a variety of applications. These could include emergency rescue or tracking of lost cell phones, missing persons, or survivors during fires.Source: ",KAIST develops new Wi-Fi indoor positioning system,https://newatlas.com/kaist-ips-wifi/25637/
"Public transport systems offer many advantages over the personal alternatives when it comes to getting large numbers of people from A to B in style and safety - less congestion, less pollution and lower costs for starters. But while we certainly see plenty of impetus on the personal transport front here at Gizmag, fresh concepts for the future of mass transport don't seem to enjoy the same level of exposure, despite the fact that many cities around the world are still saddled with public transport infrastructure that's been in place for over a century. There are some radical plans in the works, however, and the 21st Century will undoubtedly bring with it a raft of people moving projects that redefine our notion of public transport. So just what will be pulling into the station in 50 years time? Read on for our pick of the most tantalizing concepts out there.While fast, frictionless maglev train systems have been operational for decades, they haven't exactly become ubiquitous - perhaps because of the cost of the systems, or perhaps because there is no compelling need to replace the already widespread and workable conventional railway infrastructure. Either way, the idea is not about to fade from our collective imagination and several maglev of the future concepts have been floated.The  system envisions superconducting maglev trains operating in evacuated tubes at speeds of up to 6,500 km/h (4,039 mph) on international trips - that's New York to Beijing in two hours! The proponents of this system say that ET3 could be 50 times more efficient than electric cars or trains. goes even further than ultra-efficient mass transport with its vision for a network of superconducting tunnels. As well as providing infrastructure for ""Terraspan trains,"" this network would also facilitate zero loss transmission of electricity to our homes.A 500 km/h (310 mph) vacuum train project has also been proposed for Switzerland, but as the  site outs it: ""So a far-advanced technology of and for the next generation remains in the drawer.""Another high-speed rail concept that aims to present an alternative to conventional systems without the astronomical price tag is Anatoly Unitsky's . The concept is based on the use of what look like heavy-duty above ground electrical wires, but instead of carrying power, these high-tension wires become the support for carriages.The proponents of the system see big advantages in terms of cost (somewhere between three and 10 times less expensive than a railway, maglev system, monorail system or motorway) and efficiency (an 80 kW (107hp) motor would take a 20-person passenger vehicle up to 155 mph (250 km/h)).Taking the above ground rail concept further (and then turning it on its head) is Robert C. Pulliam's . In this system the trains themselves carry the tracks, while the wheels and motors are contained in elevated rings that the train passes through at speeds of up to 240 km/h (150 mph). Because the design would cause minimal disruption to existing infrastructure and the technology is readily available, Tubular Rail estimates that construction costs could be 60 percent less than conventional urban train networks.This is definitely one of the most interesting public transportation concepts we've encountered over the years when it comes to reducing urban congestion, while making use of existing infrastructure. The """" would roll on stilts  traffic using small tracks positioned between lanes of traffic while passengers get on and off at elevated bus stops. The result: additional people carrying capacity for urban roads, no disruption to traffic and no need to build completely independent track systems. Seems like a win/win, but at this stage we're not aware of any progress on the expected pilot program.Another outside-the-box approach to transport that deserves a place in our top 10 is the . This human powered monorail system uses bicycle pods suspended from tracks to create a very efficient option for getting from A to B.Currently you can ride the Shweeb at the Agroventures in New Zealand where you can reach speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) under your own steam. The idea is not limited to adventure parks though. Shweeb picked up a US$1 million investment from Google in 2010 as part of Project 10^100 and the  it will soon be announcing the planned location of the first Shweeb built for public use.The quest for more efficient transport systems doesn't necessarily have to come at the cost of speed. The  is a campaign aiming to bring high-speed (we're talking 220 mph (354 km/h)) trains to Arizona using tracks equipped with solar panel carrying canopies that would provide the 110 megawatts of electricity that the system needs to run. The  is currently in the R&D phase but faces several hurdles (not the least of which is an estimated US$27 billion pricetag) before construction of the planned Tucson to Phoenix line can get underway.While on the subject, solar isn't the only alternative energy being considered for powering train networks. The  envisions turbines incorporated into tracks that could be used to harness wind energy from the train as it whooshes overhead.While  that allow personal electric vehicles to recharge on the go are gathering momentum, these systems also hold potential for making mass transportation greener and more efficient. A real-world example of this technology has already been demonstrated in the form of a  developed by researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The pilot project in Seoul’s Grand Park in Gwacheon City involved running an engine and three passenger cars using power supply infrastructure buried under the ground in sections of a 2.2 km (1.36 mile) long track.So why not just charge the electric train at the socket? The advantage here is that the vehicle can operate with a battery that's one-fifth of the the size of batteries installed in electric vehicles currently on the market. While this means gains in efficiency, this needs to be weighed against the loss in efficiency caused by contactless charging, which in the KAIST experiment peaked at 74 percent. KAIST hopes to commercialize this technology within the next few years.These days we think of road and rail transport as completely different things, but this distinction is set to become a little muddy as technology marches towards 2050. One of the benefits of public transport in general is that it avoids the inherent chaos of personal transport where the decisions are made by individual drivers. ""Follow-the-leader"" systems are looking to solve this problem by using a lead vehicle that's wirelessly linked to a series of other cars or ""carriages"" which follow its path autonomously. The system retains the flexibility of purely private transport (i.e. vehicles can leave the train so that you don't all have to end up at the same destination), the only additional infrastructure required is the computers that link the vehicles and the benefits for road safety, decreasing congestion and reducing vehicle fuel consumption are obvious.This best of both world's idea sits in the ""very near future"" category - a European project dubbed  (Safe Road Trains for the Environment) project has been in progress since 2009 and was recently  for the first time.Some future transport concepts have loftier goals that just getting us to the station on time. While  based on more conventional rocket ships is a fast growing infant, there are also plans afoot to use ""space trains"" to launch passengers into orbit.Like the EET discussed above, the  system would use a superconducting, magnetically levitating train capsule in a vacuum tube. The difference here is that the final 12 miles (20 km) of the 1,000 mile (1,609 km) long track would point upwards, launching the ""carriage"" into low earth orbit. If that's not futuristic enough, the plan sees the skywards pointing launch tube itself being held in place by magnetic levitation!Conceived by Dr. George Maise along with one of the inventors of superconducting maglev, Dr. James Powell, the potential of this system to significantly reduce the costs of putting commercial cargo (and space tourists) into orbit is attracting serious discussion.Another long standing and noteworthy concept that aims to democratize the process of getting off the planet is the space elevator. First theorized over 100 years ago, the idea of the space elevator is to use a cable tethered to a base station to send ""climbers"" into orbit at a fraction of the cost of rocket-based launch systems.While there are a variety of designs, the key component of a working space elevator would be a thin tether made from lightweight material (carbon nanotubes are the prime candidate) that stretches from an anchor point or base station on or near the Earth's equator to a point some 60,000 miles (96,560 km) into space. The Earth's rotation and a counterweight on the upper end of the cable would keep the line taught and climbers (likely powered by solar energy) traveling at fast train pace would be sent up this futuristic beanstalk to deliver cargo and people into orbit and back.According to the International Space Elevator Consortium (), the cost of transporting cargo in this way ""will be significantly reduced in price to the realm of dollars per kilogram compared with over $20,000 per kilogram today.""This is an idea that could well become reality before the curtains are drawn on the 21st Century - in fact, Tokyo-based construction company Obayashi Corp. has stated plans to have a 96,000 kilometer (59,652 mile) space elevator capable of carrying 30 passengers at a time .Have we missed something?

Once dried, the dipped fiber isthen re-dipped in a bath of super-yellow (poly-(p-phenylenevinylene) polymerorganic LED ()) solution, dried again in an oven, and finally coated with a Lithium Fluoride/Aluminum (LiF/Al) compound.Thisprocess, the researchers claim, is a much more efficient way of applying LEDmaterials to small cylindrical structures than any heat-treating method. By carefullyadjusting the extraction rate of the fiber from the solution, the researcherssay they can control the deposition thickness to within hundreds ofthousandths of a nanometer. The researchers believe their method of producing LED fibers could be an acceleratorfor the commercialization of wearable displays because inexpensive, automated high-volume production of fibers using such textile manufacturing methods asroll-to-roll processing could be employed. In this way, LED fibers could be mass-produced as easily as nylon or polyethylene fiber is produced today.  ""Thistechnology will eventually allow the production of wearable displays to be aseasy as making clothes,"" said Seon-Il Kwon, a member of the KAIST Electrical Engineeringteam.The results of this work were recently published in the journal Source: ","Researchers create soft, weavable LED fibers for truly flexible wearable displays",https://newatlas.com/led-fiber-wearable-display-kaist/38890/
"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have created a new piezoelectric nanogenerator that promises to overcome the restrictions found in previous attempts to build a simple, low-cost, large scale self-powered energy system.Piezoelectric materials can convert vibrational and mechanical forces from, for example, wind and waves, into an electric current. This property has been harnessed to create better microphone transducers and, in more recent years, to harvest energy from , , and even .Last year, a team led by Dr. Zhong Lin Wang announced it had created the world's first  and, shortly after, also announced the first  complete with a wireless transmitter. Now Wang and his team have announced further progress in creating a low-cost, large-scale nanogenerator which is also simple to manufacture.The team produced a composite by mixing piezoelectric nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide in a matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The nanogenerator was then fabricated by process of spin-casting.""The generator is mainly made of plastics and zinc oxide, so the materials are environmentally friendly,"" says Wang.Despite its relative simplicity, the composite generates a much higher power density than other devices with a similar structure and has an energy conversion efficiency of seven percent. Wang told us that if the nanogenerator were to be embedded in a pair of shoes, an average-build person could generate around 3W just by walking. For reference, that would be roughly enough to power an iPad 2 (if you wanted to power the new iPad, however, you'd have to either pick up your pace or put on a few pounds).Preliminary durability studies have confirmed that, even after thousands of cycles in which the material was repeatedly bent and released, the nanogenerator consistently produced the same amount of electric current, with no noticeable degradation in performance.As Wang points out, the applications of such a technology are very broad and could include biosensing, medical devices, environmental and health monitoring, defense technology, and - why not - the .A  (PDF) detailing the findings was featured in the April online issue of the journal.Source: ","KAIST develops low-cost, large-area piezoelectric nanogenerator",https://newatlas.com/low-cost-large-area-piezoelectric-nanogenerator/22468/
"In the days of yore, families would gather round the table of an evening and play board games like  and . With such games moving into the virtual world and now available online - along with much more graphically impressive computer games - even those playing the same game under the same roof can be tucked away in their own corner of the house. An innovative game robot concept out of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) called MoleBot attempts to reverse the trend by providing a physical environment that allows users to physically interact with a virtual game world.Like an oversized pin impression board that has been laid flat, the MoleBot table is a shape display that consists of an array of around 15,000 small hexagonal pins that slide up and down. The MoleBot itself is a dome-shaped plastic mold separated from the pins by a layer of spandex that reduces friction as it moves. Inside the MoleBot is a magnet that pairs up with a strong neodymium magnet attached to a head that moves along the x- and y-axes. When the MoleBot moves, the pins above it rise up smoothly, giving the impression of a mole moving under the surface of the table. Users can control the MoleBot with a joystick or with hand gestures using a .The ability for the MoleBot to move and “pick up” magnetic objects on the surface of the table, or simply push things around, is sure to be fertile ground for young minds to come up with their own games. While creating a new game interface was the initial goal for Professor Lee Woohun’s team from the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST, Lee says he is now looking at applying the technology to different fields, including human-computer interaction, architecture, and even clothing.Having unveiled the MoleBot at SIGGRAPH in August 2011, the KAIST team recently nabbed the “Gran Prix du Jury” at the Laval Virtual 2012 virtual reality exhibition, making it a very successful showing for the first ever entry from a Korean team at the event.Here's a video describing the MoleBot table's construction and showing a few of the games that can be played using it.Source: ",MoleBot gaming interface blends the virtual and physical,https://newatlas.com/molebot/22469/
"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via non-contact magnetic charging. As well as potentially saving Koreans a lot of money by reducing crude oil imports, widespread adoption of the technology also offers the potential of improving air quality in currently polluted cities.The drive towards adoption of the electric vehicle as a popular and viable means of transport is beginning to highlight a few potential road blocks which may not be enough to halt progress but may require some inventive thinking. Limitations on battery size and power, the issue of battery weight, the range of an electric vehicle between charges, how long it takes to recharge the batteries, and not forgetting the availability of charging points and who foots the bill - all currently hot topics in the world of electric vehicle creation.There's also a resource issue waiting in the wings to raise its problematic head some time soon. As more vehicles become reliant on drawing their power from batteries, supplies of the compounds and metals on which they are based may become less and less readily available. Dwindling stocks of things like lithium could start to command increasingly high prices and lead to electric vehicles pricing themselves out of the automotive marketplace.Thankfully solutions are already being offered, such as the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV) from . Rather than relying on battery technology, the OLEV picks up charge using a non-contact magnetic charging method (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself) so it doesn't matter if the car is moving or parked up, it still receives power.In February 2009 KAIST researchers illustrated that it is possible for a vehicle to receive up to 80% power conveyance with a 1cm gap between the vehicle and the power line. A subsequent test drive of the technology (see gallery) was attended by dignitaries and government officials, including Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and provided the researchers with an opportunity to promote the concept.As a possible solution to traffic congestion and to improve overall efficiency by minimizing air resistance and so reduce energy consumption, the test vehicles followed the power track in a convoy formation. It's thought that road safety and vehicle efficiency could be enhanced further by adopting technology that would allow the OLEV to drive itself in convoy mode, something recently discussed by the .In July 2009 the researchers successfully supplied up to 60% power to a bus over a gap of 12cm from a power line embedded in the ground using power supply and pick up technology developed in-house.It is thought that if only half of the Koreans currently on the road switched to the OLEV system, the country could reduce its imports of crude oil by 35 billion barrels per year, saving an estimated USD$3 billion. Thanks to the positive reception the technology has received at recent demonstrations, KAIST has set up a company to take care of activities which will hopefully see the systems through to commercial production and release, and possible future export.",Korean electric vehicle solution,https://newatlas.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/
"March 23, 2009 It has been a big week for news on advances in energy storage technology. We recently reported on new research that makes a perform more like a supercapacitor, now we can report on research on  a supercapacitor that performs more like a battery. Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have developed a supercapacitor with 10 billion nanoscale capacitors per square centimeter, giving it 250 times greater surface area than that of a conventional capacitor of comparable size. The Nano Supercapacitor is being developed primarily as part of a hybrid battery-capacitor system for electric cars.Batteries, particularly lithium-ion, store large amounts of energy but have more difficulty with high power or fast recharge. Capacitors, on the other hand, can be charged or discharged at a very high rate. Existing supercapacitors have an energy densities around 1/10th that of a conventional battery, but their power density is generally ten to one-hundred times as greatThe Maryland/KAIST research team’s new devices are electrostatic nanocapacitors which increase the energy storage density of such devices by a factor of 100  over that of commercially available devices without sacrificing the high power they traditionally characteristically offer. Current commercial supercapacitors range from 0.5 to 30 Wh/kg, while the research is in its early stages, if they reach their claim of a 100 increase that will result in 3,000 Wh/kg.  For comparison, a conventional lead-acid battery is typically 30 to 40 Wh/kg and modern lithium-ion batteries are about 160 Wh/kg. In automobile applications gasoline contains around 12,000 wh/kg, which operates at 15% tank-to-wheel efficiency giving an effective energy density of 1800 Wh/kgUsing Atomic fabrication techniques the process starts with  a sheet of aluminum foil that is anodized to form a regularly spaced array of nanopores across its surface. Each nanopore as small as 50 nanometers in diameter and up to 30 micrometers deep. Next a sandwich of two layers of titanium nitride (TiN) metal separated by an insulation layer are deposited using Atomic layer deposition into the pores topped with another layer of aluminum foil. The two outer foil layers act as the electrical contacts.The researchers have made a prototype with 125-micrometer-wide arrays, each containing one million nanocapacitors. There are many scale-up issues as they want to make a large area that contains billions of nanocapacitors to store large amounts of energy and they have to make sure that they can effectively connect multiple arrays to one another.  The team are still deciding how best to commercialize this. The  hybrid battery-capacitor system for electric cars would contain multiple energy storage panels stacked together inside a car battery system. The energy storage panels could also be integrated into solar panels and the flat panel displays seen in most portable devices.Via: .",New Nanoscale supercapacitor can store 100 times more energy,https://newatlas.com/nanoscale-supercapacitor/11297/
"There may indeed come a day when printed books and magazines have been gone for so long, that nobody cares how little reading a digital document resembles reading one printed on paper. That day is not yet here, however - most of us still like our e-reading experience to be as close as possible to that of reading a book. To that end, this week a team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) announced the development of new e-reading system, that brings several book-like capabilities to tablets and smartphones.Called the Smart E-book System, the ""algorithm-based conversion technology"" incorporates the off-screen border area of touchscreen devices, which is known as the bezel. By placing a finger or thumb on the bezel then sliding it into the screen (or sliding it off the screen and onto the bezel), users can do things such as flipping through pages one at a time, or quickly riffling through whole sheaves of them - forwards or backwards.They can also stick a finger on one page to bookmark it, continue flipping using another finger until they get to a different page that catches their interest, then cross-reference between the two pages by virtually folding the stack of intervening pages back and forth.Other features that aren't necessarily book-like include the ability to control how many pages are flipped by varying either the number of fingers applied to the screen (two fingers for two pages, three for three, and so on), the speed of finger gestures, or the amount of time that the finger is applied. Other functions can be controlled through different  of finger gestures - drawing out a number, for instance, will take the user to the page bearing that number.There is no word yet on whether any device manufacturers have expressed an interest in the  technology.The video below shows the Smart E-book System in use.",New e-book system promises a more paper-like reading experience,https://newatlas.com/smart-e-book-system/21097/
"The commercialization of  developed by researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has taken another step forward with the introduction of an OLEV “train” for public transportation in Seoul’s Grand Park in Gwacheon City. The vehicle picks up electricity from power cables buried underground through a non-contact magnetic charging method and replaces a trackless combustion engine train running inside the park.The power pickup equipment installed underneath the OLEV collects  and distributes the power either to operate the vehicle or for battery storage. Whether running or stopped, the OLEV constantly receives electric power through the underground cables. As a result, OLEV mitigates the burden of equipping electric vehicle with heavy, bulky batteries – the OLEV's battery size is one-fifth of the batteries installed in electric vehicles currently on the market.A road embedded with underground recharging strips is divided into several segments so that, when a car drives on a certain segment, a sensor in the segment is turned on, and the car above the segment picks up electricity. Because charging occurs in transit there is no need to establish charging stations or set aside time for recharging that leaves the vehicle is idle.KAIST says that if the OLEV charging method is applied to the public bus system in South Korea, the underground power lines need to be installed on only 20 percent of the total bus route at places like bus stops, parking lots, and intersections.Also removing direct contact with charging sources prevents electrical hazards, such as electric shock. And the contactless-charging method is safe for pedestrians and other conventional vehicles, with electromagnetic radiation (EMF) test results for OLEV being well below the 1998 the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guideline, 62.5mG at 20khz.The OLEV train running at Seoul Grand Park consists of one engine and three passenger cars and travels along a total length of 2.2km (1.36 miles). The route contains four sections of power supply infrastructure – three sections measuring 122.5 meters (402 feet) long and one five meters (16.4 feet) long.  The power supply cables were installed under the road surface for a total of 372.5 meters (1,222 feet), which is 16 percent of the route’s total distance.In terms of power system transmission efficiency, KAIST's research team achieved a maximum pick-up capacity of 62kw/h, 74% with an airgap height of 13cm (5.1-in) from the road to the bottom of the vehicle – a 12cm (4.7-in) airgap is required for practical vehicle application in accordance with South Korean law.The city government of Seoul and  signed a Memorandum of Understating (MOU) on the development of the online electric vehicle in August 2009. The two organizations agreed to introduce eco-friendly vehicles to the city's public transportation system, beginning with a bus route in Seoul.The introduction of the OLEV train is the second step in KAIST’s roadmap that leads to the eventual commercialization of the technology. The next step involves the development of practical prototype technology for OLEV (2011), followed by the development of standard prototype technology (2012) and finally the introduction of a commercial product to the market in 2013.",KAIST reveals proof of concept OLEV power road,https://newatlas.com/kaist-proof-of-concept-olev-power-road/14454/
"It’s starting to look like roads will become much more than simple thoroughfares made of concrete and asphalt in the not too distant future. As we’ve seen, work is already underway to embed them with  and  to generate electricity. Now engineering company Ingenieurgesellschaft Auto und Verkehr (IAV) is looking to embed them with electrical conductors that would “refuel” the electric cars of the future while they are driving or parked.The technology is similar to that being developed by researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) for the  (OLEV), and can already be seen in automobile production plants and large warehouse facilities where robotic floor conveyor vehicles are supplied with power and automatically steered using the same method. As with those systems, inductive loops buried in the roadway would generate a magnetic field to supply the cars with energy without the need for cables and connectors.This contactless transfer of energy is enabled by taking advantage of the Maxwell electromagnetic laws, whereby an electric current flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field. In the case of an alternating current, this induces a voltage in a second conductor, even though the two conductors are not in contact with one another. Using precisely controlled frequencies of the applied alternating current, high-efficiency energy transmission from the sending to the receiving electrical circuits is ensured.Through this principle, IAV is pushing towards a future where roadways would be fitted with buried electrical conductors to generate a magnetic field, while the floorpan of the electric car would be fitted with their counterpart, a non-contacting inductive pickup. This would allow current to be induced to provide power for the vehicle while it is in motion, or stockpiled until the battery is fully charged when the vehicle is parked. Electromagnetic induction also has the benefits of being insensitive to weather conditions and free of mechanical wear.Not only would the system be able to act as a “range extender” for electric powered vehicles, it would also allow remote control of the vehicles. The primary conductor buried in the road could also carry a control signal to produce a “virtual rail” for the vehicles to follow, much like a slot-free . The control system would also be needed to activate the charging process when sensors detect with absolute certainty that there was indeed an electric car over the inductive field. IAV suggest the sensors to detect an electric car could take the form of RFID chips, which would also be used to charge the driver for the cost of the power transmitted.IAV claims that inductive transmission losses are relatively low, at about ten percent, and that the system is highly efficient, which means that only limited sections of the roadway would need to be fitted with induction loops. The system is, however, very sensitive to the distance between the road and the vehicle floorpan, so IAV suggest that the electric vehicles could employ active suspension and opto-electronic measurement techniques to automatically maintain the optimum distance. is confident that its electromagnetic induction technology will be developed to production-ready status in the next few years. A 1/28 scale model of the system is already “functioning perfectly” the company says, and construction of a demonstration section of “charging road,” and a full-scale test track, are in the planning stages in the German state of Lower Saxony.Battery-powered vehicles face many obstacles, including the range of the vehicle, the time required to recharge the battery, and the placement of charging points, to name just a few. An electromagnetic induction system offers a solution to these problems, but the cost involved in constructing the infrastructure of such a system would be immense. For this reason, it’s probably more likely that we’ll see the system employed on limited routes for trams or buses before being extended to general roads and streets, but maybe the days of running out of fuel are numbered.Check out the video below for a graphical demonstration of the IAV system.",Drawing power from the road,https://newatlas.com/drawing-power-from-the-road/12874/
"In recent years, polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted attention as a replacement for petroleum-based plastics. It is made from corn-starch, or other starch-rich substances like maize, sugar or wheat, and is biodegradable – reverting in less than 60 days in ideal conditions. PLA is already used as a material for compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware, and also for a number of biomedical applications, such as sutures, stents, dialysis media and drug delivery devices. Although its price has been falling, PLA is still more expensive than most petroleum-derived commodity plastics, but now a team of researchers has succeeded in simplifying the production of PLA and making the process much cheaper, meaning we could soon see PLA used in a much wider variety of applications.Until now PLA has been produced in a two-step fermentation and chemical process of polymerization, which is complex and expensive. Now, through the use of a metabolically-engineered strain of , the team from South Korea’s  and the chemical company , have developed a one-stage process which produces polylactic acid and its copolymers through direct fermentation. This makes the renewable production of PLA and lactate-containing copolymers cheaper and more commercially viable.""By developing a strategy which combines metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering, we've developed an efficient bio-based one-step production process for PLA and its copolymers,"" said the research team’s leader, Prof Sang Yup Lee. ""This means that a developed E.coli strain is now capable of efficiently producing unnatural polymers, through a one-step fermentation process.""This combined approach of systems-level metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering now allows for the production of polymer and polyester-based products through direct microbial fermentation of renewable resources.""The polyesters and other polymers we use everyday are mostly derived from fossil oils made through the refinery or chemical process,"" said Lee. ""The idea of producing polymers from renewable biomass has attracted much attention due to the increasing concerns of environmental problems and the limited nature of fossil resources.
