"Improved download speeds of 10Gbit/s – a considerable increase from the 150Mbit/s of 4G LTE and 300Mbit/s of 4G LTE-Advanced – move 5G wireless access networks beyond 4G’s communication and information sharing status. These download speeds will enable networks in industrial, municipal, retail and transport areas where machines will be able to monitor and control the information and data sent around the network.An example of just how far 5G can reach was demonstrated by a weekend deployment of a 5G urban network in Bristol. In March this year, the University of Bristol’s Smart Internet Lab ‘took over’ the city’s Millennium Square to demonstrate 5G services, such as smart cities’ synchronised traffic systems, autonomous transport and augmented reality.The Layered Realities Weekend was, says the Smart Internet Lab, the world’s first demonstration of an end-to-end 5G urban network.The network testbed consisted of 5G New Radio (5G NR) heads, the air interface between the mobile device and basestation. These were connected to the 5G virtualised baseband pool using multiple protocols with dynamic low latency aggregation and variable bandwidth allocation to the fibre backhaul via an end-to-end software defined networking (SDN) -controlled environment.Dimitra Simeonidou, Smart Internet Lab’s director, credits the programmability of Xilinx devices used in the 5G network testbed for enabling the different edge functions. “Central to our architecture has been the flexibility and programmability of the network edge, including traffic aggregation and computing, as well as disaggregation of hardware-hosted network functions across the infrastructure,” she says. “We used Xilinx’s platform to support this architecture.”The Smart Internet Lab 5G open hardware solutions are transferable, and there are plans to deploy it in other cities across Europe, she says.The project was funded by the Department of Digital Culture Media and Sports (DCMS) in conjunction with BT, CCS, Nokia and Zeetta Networks.All communications and networks were channelled through the university’s lab, whichcreated ‘5G‑in‑a‑box’ (above), which included Xilinx’s Virtex FPGAs.A Massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antenna was used to boost network capacity and reduce congestion. Standard MIMO networks use two or four antennae to transmit and receive multiple data signals simultaneously over the same radio channel. Massive MIMO increases the number of antennae to 10s or 100s of antennae to provide multiple signal path options.Increasing the number of antennae packed into a space means that they operate at higher frequencies than conventional mobile networks, boosting signals. This is a particular advantage for outdoor signal paths. Using beamforming technology allows networks to target a spectrum to use, while a multitude of antennae means that signals are less likely to jam and be more resistant to interference.To accommodate the expected 50 million or more connected devices, 5G networks must be able to accommodate multiple technologies, including Massive MIMO and CloudRAN’s (cloud radio access network) centralised baseband processing to increase coverage and data throughput. Networks need to be relied on to securely connect. “The increased bandwidth from 5G will require extra bandwidth capacity,” advises Gilles Garcia, director of communications business (wired and wireless) at Xilinx.“There will be a ripple effect, with backhaul and fronthaul both seeing aggregation levels, and cores will need to support them from multiple pipes into the core,” he says.Garcia explains that programmable FPGAs and SoCs are critical in implementing 5G proof of concepts, testbeds and early commercialisation trials. It is partly because silicon does not yet exist and ASICs are not viable in the early stages of a 5G standardisation phase. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to support enhanced algorithmic implementations or to support functionality, he points out.“Programmability is required to evolve algorithms and to aggregate different data to many clients to accelerate connectivity,” he says. “Xilinx devices are the only way to achieve this in production volumes and to avoid the obsolescence of devices through programmability.”Xilinx believes its All Programmable technology can support multiple standards, multiple bands and the multiple sub-networks for diverse IoT-driven applications, securely.Xilinx Kinetix devices were used in the Massive MIMO, and Zynq All-Programmable SoCs were used for the control plane.The increased performance of 5G can be used in smart cities to monitor and control traffic systems, and also lighting and energy utilities for improved efficiencies. It can also be used to monitor remote systems, such as water management in agriculture, and in retail, it could enable shoppers to use augmented reality to drive sales, suggests Dan Isaacs, director for connected systems, corporate strategic marketing at Xilinx. Another example he gives is that machine learning can be used for security functions, exploiting the download speeds to transfer alerts or images for surveillance.At this year’s Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, 5G was deployed in many forms to improve the experience of those attending and watching the games, says Paul Bradley, head of 5G strategy and partnerships at Gemalto. As well as a 5G network for mobile users, there were also examples of virtual reality and artificial intelligence for visitors and 5G even had a role in athletes’ training.Two speed skaters on the Netherlands team were using SmartSuits during their training, allowing them to communicate with the team coach while on the ice.Each tailormade SmartSuit had five sensors, sending data about body position to the coach’s Galaxy S8 smartphone. An app on the phone calculated the racer’s body position as they sped and turned on the ice. The coach could send a signal to one of the sensors on the suit to signal that the skater’s position should be adjusted.There were also 85 hospitality robots around the event (see Electronics Weekly 18 April 2018). These robots provided information about transport, attractions and schedules, and were able to communicate in Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English. One highlight, says Bradley, was a humanoid robot, built by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), which used 5G’s connectivity to serve as a bearer for the Olympic torch last December, on part of the route near the institute itself in Daejeon, 160km south of Seoul.“Leveraging the 5G network, self‑driving buses were in action throughout the games, serving thousands of fans who required swift, efficient and safe transport between the multiple venues,” says Bradley.The buses were the result of a joint project between KT and Hyundai and thanks to the speed of the network, they received information in real time from a control centre, helping them avoid obstacles or collisions with other vehicles en route to each destination.“The buses were powered by electric fuel-cells, helping cut pollution around the venues. And for the buses that did have human drivers, they used the latest safety technology to ensure no errors are made. There was no danger of drivers falling asleep at the wheel either, as the buses monitored each driver’s facial expressions (such as how long their eyes might be closed) and generated an alert when distractions or tired driving were detected.“The buses were able to download and display large 3D video files on transparent screens, giving fans front‑row seats to the action, before they’d even arrived at the venue of their chosen event.”“Fans in PyeongChang were able to witness the capability of 5G and the future of telecomms in the new 5G village, which was located at Uiyaji Wind Village, close to the venues,” says Bradley.“There, the ICT centre hosted virtual reality (VR) experiences. Visitors could experience riding a speeding bobsleigh, or snowboard along some of the most challenging courses, all from the comfort and safety of a simulator.“Live VR experiences were also running. Thanks to the power of 5G, fans could enjoy real-time clips of skiers and snowboarders flying past large camera rigs positioned next to jumps and near the middle of ski runs, bringing the action closer to home than ever. Throughout the games, Intel’s True View multiview cameras captured approximately 50 hours of real time 360o VR footage of at least 30 of the winter sports, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies,” he says.A 5G wireless network covered all the venues. “This enabled broadcasts at speeds of up to 50 times faster than the current LTE network,” and allowed people to instantly distribute crystal clear images of the action, according to Bradley. “5G made this year’s Winter Games the most exciting so far, helping to create a demand for faster, better networks around the world. What was tested in PyeongChang is still an early showcase of the technology’s capabilities, and so it is very exciting to see how 5G will develop in the near future.”Asia is expected to see the first deployments of 5G; China Mobile expects 5G to be ready next year and Japan’s largest mobile service provider, NTT Docomo, is developing 5G wireless communication systems using channel‑sounding at mmWave frequencies and Keysight’s 28GHz Channel Sounding Solution with wideband MIMO data capture techniques. Engineers can measure angular spread with fewer measurements and improve resolution of the multi-path parameters and understand the channel behaviour at mmWave frequencies travelling at high speeds.",5G prepares for action,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/design/communications/5g-prepares-action-2018-04/
"The pill is a dome-ended cylinder 32mm long and 12mm in diameter. From its central section, four VGA cameras, each with four illumination LEDs, face outward to provide a 360° sideways view at 4frame/s, while a gold plated hemispherical electrode at each end provide an electrode pair that can couple signals into local body tissue, whose feint traces can be picked up at the body surface where a vest with eight skin electrodes receive them – a scheme dubbed ‘body channel communication (BCC). Power comes from a pair of 1.55V 55mAh cells.Key to operation is a sophisticated transceiver scheme implemented in two custom chips, developed between KAIST and Kangwon National University, one in the pill and one per electrode in the vest.Pill-to-skin image up-link transmission, after compression through a DPCM encoder, is over two bands: QPSK modulation (DAC-based) at 40MHz and BPSK at 160MHz. Control codes travel in the other direction separately through an OOK-modulated low-speed data link.The four image sensors are enabled sequentially with 2% duty cycle onto the up-link, consuming <1mW from 1V to send all the images, then the chips at both ends switch into location mode for part of the remaining cycle.In this mode impedance is initially used as a proxy for distance, allowing the four closest skin electrodes to be adaptively selected for more accurate location which finally uses a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on cost functions to extract actual position from the various impedance values.For this scheme to work, the vagaries of electrode-to-skin resistance are reduced using a further live measurement scheme. Up to 10kΩ of contact impedance variation is measured by injecting a 1.25MHz current.“With contact impedance compensation, average localization error decreases from 4.89cm to 0.98cm,” said the team at the International Solid State Circuit Conference (ISSCC) in San Francisco, where the pill was revealed.The 4x4mm pill chip was fabricated in 65nm mixed-signal CMOS process and consumes 0.8-1.7mW, equating to an efficiency of 0.022nJ/bit. The received chips, also 4 x 4mm, consume 8mW.

"It is based on the ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene), built into a heterostructure with two conductive fabrics (diagram right), which can then be applied to fabric by a similar hot-pressing process to that used to attach graphics to T-shirts – taking two to three minutes on polyester.The patch has been analysed electrically and theoretically, as well as physically using a surface and interfacial cutting analysis system (SAICAS – image left).“This study could enable the commercialisation of durable wearable devices based on the analysis of their interfacial adhesion strength,” said Professor Seungbum Hong. “Our study lays a foundation for the manufacturing process and analysis of other devices using fabrics and polymers. We look forward to fabric-based wearable electronics hitting the market very soon.”The polymer used here offers a piezoelectric modulus of −32.0pC/N, and the layers of the harvester stick together with a strength of 22N/cm.Strong bonding comes from the temperature at which the patch is processed.“The polymer film is pressed onto a fabric below its crystallization temperature and transforms into an amorphous state,” according to KAIST. “In this state, it compactly attaches to the concave surface of the fabric and infiltrates into the gaps between the transverse wefts and longitudinal warps. These features result in high interfacial adhesion strength.”",Flexible piezo-harvester sticks well to fabric,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/flexible-piezo-harvester-sticks-well-fabric-2020-09/
" Two ofthe papers in the microprocessor session gave details of simultaneous multi-threading(SMT) techniques. Young-Don Bae from Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science andTechnology (KAIST) described his 32-bit Risc processor (left) capable of handling 15threads. Basic instructions are similar to ARM, Bae said, for good code density anddevelopment tools. The processor is connected to configurable   logic clusters. Meanwhile,Ronald Preston from Compaq proposed a four thread, eight-way superscalar Alpha processor.The EV8 programme was cancelled by Compaq and will never see the light of day, but itmarks the current zenith of processor design. The chip increases cache from 1.5 to 3Mbyteand moves from 0.175 to 0.125?SOI. SMT accounts for six per cent more die, but can doubleperformance, said the firm.

" One of thedevice industry’s biggest challenges is integrating more passive components on-chip.Inductors are arguably the most tricky problem.                                                                    While putting an inductor on chip is well understood, getting a reasonable Q value forthat inductor is difficult.  A research team from the department of electrical engineering at KAIST in Korea hasbuilt spiral copper inductors that ‘float’ above the substrate.  A higher Q is realised by minimising parasitic losses arising from inductor contactwith the substrate. The image on the left shows a common air-bridge inductor, while the other two showKAIST’s design, one without any extra supports. The design on the left would realise a Q of, at best, around 20. KAIST has managed toproduce a Q of 50 at inductances of 1.8nH at 7GHz.  Using a glass substrate, they achieved a Q of 57 at 10GHz. The format also improves integration density, because other RF circuits can beintegrated under the inductor. Although the structures look weak, their size actually makes them strong.  Unsupported copper lines up to 10mm long have been made that survive well, the teamsaid. The inductors could be added to existing CMOS chips easily. All processing is carriedout at less than 120?C.

"And was a bit shocked at how much power might be wasted by this system – tens of MW.Now engineer Les Birt has had a detailed look through, and he thinks there is a fundamental error in the study assumptions, leading to a significant .His main point is that an efficiency figure for grid-to-wheel efficiency of 73% is used in the study is far too optimistic:Using an existing Government figure of 80% for battery-to-wheel efficiency means that the study is assuming an efficiency of 91% for everything in the wireless system from grid to the car battery ie: roadside converter-transmitter, moving transformer and in-car receiver.According to Birt, no such wireless efficiency is substantiated by any published research data.This is his letter to the Highways Agency:I think this feasibility study contains an error which is core to all the power requirement calculations shown in the study.Section 7.1.1 states the power calculation assumption:- “The wheel to grid efficiency is assumed to be 73% when the DWPT is used to provide traction power to the vehicle”.Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology briefing  shows the battery to wheel efficiency for a light electric vehicle as being 80%.Add a conventional high efficiency, wire connected battery charger (say 95% efficient) and the overall grid-to-wheel efficiency is 76% (80% x 95%).This figure is typical in other reports (70-75%).Section 5.7.1 of the study states that “the input/output overall efficiency is 72%”. It does not state whether this is the grid to wheel efficiency and, if not, what grid to wheel efficiency has been achieved.In this installation, the vehicle is parked, carefully-aligned, and close coupled (4 to 6cm, using a coil that is lowered to the road). The report states that the efficiency of any dynamic charging system will be lower (therefore <72%).Section 5.3 the study, quite rightly, identifies the KAIST system as being the most market-ready dynamic wireless charging system.Why has the wheel-to-grid efficiency achieved by KAIST not been included in the feasibility study?How does this compare with 73%?To assume in the feasibility study that a dynamic wireless power transfer systems grid to wheel efficiency can be 73%, in the face of the above, is unsound.From the above figures, it seems more likely that a low speed, high coil spacing, lane aligned, dynamic wireless charging system has a grid to battery efficiency around 45 to 50%.This equates to a grid to wheel efficiency of 40%, far below the 73% assumed in the feasibility study.This increases the report’s predicted power demand figure of 4MVA/mile increases to 7.3MVA/mile.Sincerely Les Birt MIET",Isn’t wireless car charging only 50% efficient?,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/engineer-in-wonderland/general-engineer-in-wonderland/isnt-wireless-car-charging-only-50-efficient-2015-09/
"The process starts with a flash memory wafer diced after thinning to ~100nm.These die are attached to a plastic carrier film, which allows them to be transferred to a roller and pressed onto a flexible PCB supported by a flat plate.The team suggests tolerance control is such that multiple die can simultaneously be applied to multiple PCBs by a single roller.Thermo-compression bonding attaches the die to the PCB because between the die and PCBs is a thin sheet consisting of conductive particles sparsely-distributed in an solid bonding medium – an ‘anisotropic conductive film’ (ACF). Once compressed and heated, the ACF conducts through its thickness – making connections between die and PCB – without forming short-circuits because it does not conduct sideways.“The final silicon-based flexible NAND memory  demonstrated stable memory operations and interconnections even under severe bending conditions, said research lab KAIST. “This roll-based flexible LSI technology can be potentially used to produce flexible application processors high-density memories, and high-speed communication devices for mass manufacture.”KAIST, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, worked with the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM).“We employed the roll-to-plate ACF packaging, which showed outstanding bonding capability for continuous roll-based transfer and excellent flexibility of interconnecting core and peripheral devices. This can be a key process to the new era of flexible computers combining the already developed flexible displays and batteries,” said Dr Jae-Hyun Kim of KIMM.Results will be published in  Advanced Materials as ‘Simultaneous roll transfer and iInterconnection of silicon NAND flash memory’.",Korea develops roll-based packaging for flexible silicon ICs,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/korea-develops-roll-based-packaging-flexible-silicon-ics-2016-08/

There’s the rise of electronic payments, the safe handling of rogue drones, Power Integrations adding GaN devices to its ac-dc power chips, TSMC hiring engineers and installing Android TV on a Raspberry Pi. Between January and May there were 8.7% fewer cash withdrawals in London than in the same period last year; in the South East the decline was 7.9%; in the South West the drop was 7.7%, and in the North-East the decline was 3.7%, says LINK the UK’s biggest ATM network. Total cash withdrawals measured both by value and volume of notes peaked in 2012. Forget nets, attack drones, or lasers – Korean researchers have found a way to coax rogue drones out of the sky – at least, most of those flying on GPS autopilot. “This technology can safely guide a drone to a desired location without any sudden change in direction in emergency situations,” according to national research university KAIST. Spoof GPS signals have been tried before, according to KAIST, but can push the drone into what the team describes as ‘GPS safety mode’. Power Integrations has added GaN devices to its range of ac-dc power chips. “The ICs feature up to 95% efficiency across the full load range and up to 100W in enclosed adaptor implementations without requiring a heatsink,” according to the firm. “This increase in performance is achieved using an internally developed high-voltage GaN switch technology.” TSMC is to hire more than 3,000 new employees in Hsinchu, Taichung, and Tainan. Its fortunes turned dramatically in June when, after five successive drops in y-o-y revenues, it recorded a y-o-y revenue rise of 21.9% – which was a 6.8% rise on May.

"No camera is involved. Instead the technique processes data from the phone’s microphone, accelerometer and gyroscope – recorded simultaneously as the phone is tapped on the object.The system was trained on 23 everyday objects – including books, laptop computers, water bottles, and bicycles.“Machine learning is used to analyse these responses and classify and identify objects,” according to KAIST. “In noisy environments such as a busy café or on the side of a road, it achieved 83% identification accuracy. In a quiet indoor environment, the accuracy rose to 98%.”This learning has been built into an app called Knocker – which the team believes will open a new way to interact with objects – knocking on an empty water bottle could automatically order full water bottles through an e-commerce app, for example, or knocking on a bed headboard late at night could turn off the lights and set an alarm through IoT links. At UbiComp (ACM International joint conference on pervasive and ubiquitous computing) in London last month, the team revealed 15 applications that it had implemented.“This new technology does not require any specialised sensor or hardware,” said KAIST’s Professor Sung-Ju Lee. “It simply uses the built-in sensors on smartphones and takes advantage of the power of machine learning.

"TRRAM (Transparent Resistive RAM) is a derivation of the RRAM (Resistive RAM) currently being developed by Fujitsu, Sharp and Samsung as a mainstream memory alternative to flash, phase change, ferroelectric memory, and MRAM.According to KAIST researchers, TTRAM can be manufactured inexpensively, could be in volume production in three to four years and allows data retention of 10 years.While KAIST does not see TRRAM as a mainstream memory or logic contender, it sees it as being used in applications like a wall-mounted display where all the electronic componentry is transparent.Jung Won Seo, one of the authors of a paper entitled “Transparent resistive random access memory and its characteristics for nonvolatile resistive switching,” published earlier this week in the American Institute of Physics’ Applied Physics Letters, says: “It is a new milestone of transparent electronic systems. By integrating TRRAM device with other transparent electronic components, we can create a total see-through embedded electronic system.” TRRAM also offers the potential of flexible electronics circuits, according to the KAIST researchers. The researchers point to the possibility of a flexible mobile lphone which they suggest that the technology could make possible.Another of the paper’s authors, Professor Jae-Woo Park, says: “We are sure that TRRAM will become one of alternative devices to current CMOS-based flash memory in the near future after its reliability is proven and once any manufacturing issues are solved.” ",See-through semis could revolutionise displays,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/products/led/see-through-semis-could-revolutionise-displays-2008-12/

"Wake-up radio is a way of cutting the power consumption of a seldom-used receiver – in this case an active car tag for road tolling. Inside a wake-up radio there are two receivers: a simple low-power one that is just complex enough to recognise the desired signal, and a more power-hungry full featured receiver that demodulates and decodes data from the signal; as well as a transmitter if two-way communication is required. The simple receiver awaits the signal and, when it thinks it has found it, wakes the comprehensive receiver. Best power consumption is achieved when the simple receiver is just sophisticated enough not false-trigger the full receiver too often. To help the system along, the desired signal can be customised for wake-up reception. In the case presented at ISSCC, the data part of the signal – modulated at 256kbit/s – is preceded by 15-17 cycles of simple 14kHz AM modulation. The team rejected a SAW front-end for the wake-up receiver as being too wideband (leading to false triggering), and too lossy to be sensitive enough. Instead, they used a four transistor LC-tuned high-gain RF envelope detector feeding a comparator as a one-bit ADC (see diagram). Following this, a low-power delay-based band-pass filter decides if the tell-tail 14kHz signal is present. Made on 0.13µm CMOS, final sensitivity in the wake-up radio is -45dBm (MI=0.85). The associated full receiver is similar in architecture, but has an LNA before the envelope detector, and an analogue band-pass filter between that and the one-bit ADC. 256kbit/s decoding is on a separate chip. Sensitivity is -61dBm (MI=0.85) and current consumption is 19mA. The +5dBm transmitter on the same chip draws 40mA delivering data at 512kbit/s. The design is a team effort between KAIST and PhyChips.

"The matrix of ultra-thin n-type transparent oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) for the backplane were initially fabricated on a sacrificial laser-reactive substrate.Laser irradiation from the backside of the substrate split off only the oxide TFT array as a result of reaction with the laser-reactive layer.The free transistors were transferred to a 4μm  polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, and then the combination was further transferred conformally to the surface of human skin and artificial leather to demonstrate the possibility of the wearable application.“The attached oxide TFTs showed high optical transparency of 83% and 40cm2/Vs even under several cycles of severe bending tests,” said KAIST.The method is called inorganic-based laser lift-off (ILLO).“By using our ILLO process, the technological barriers for high performance transparent flexible displays have been overcome at a relatively low cost by removing expensive polyimide substrates. Moreover, the high-quality oxide semiconductor can be easily transferred onto skin-like, or any flexible, substrate for wearable application,” said Professor Keon Jae Lee.Conformal displays are a potential application.“With the advent of the Internet of Things era, demand has grown for wearable and transparent displays that can be applied to fields such as augmented reality and skin-like thin flexible devices,” said KAIST. “However, previous flexible transparent displays have poor transparency and low electrical performance. To improve the transparency and performance, past research efforts have tried to use inorganic-based electronics, but the fundamental thermal instabilities of plastic substrates have hampered the high temperature process, an essential step necessary for the fabrication of high performance electronic devices.”‘‘, is published in Advanced Functional Materials. ",Flexible circuit is only 4μm thick,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/flexible-circuit-4%ce%bcm-thick-2016-08/

There’s the stretchable OLED display, a  post on Huawei, Marvell and Samsung collaborating on 5G infrastructure products, a look back to 2003 and how SARS disrupted the electronics industry, and the ongoing battle between HP and Xerox… An engineered substrate is the key to a stretchable OLED display built by the Korean lab KAIST, that could lead to stretchable full-colour displays. The novel substrate is there to allow rigid pixels to be incorporated. “Traditional intrinsically stretchable OLEDs have commercial limitations due to their low efficiency in the electrical conductivity of the electrodes,” according to KAIST.  []At the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco last week, Andy Purdy, US chief security officer of Huawei came up against Katie Arrington from the US Department of Defence. Purdy helped draft the US National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, worked at the Department of Homeland Security and helped launch the US National Cyber Security Division, before joining Huawei in 2013. When asked whether it was hypocritical that the US and the UK can spy, but China is not allowed to, Arrington replied that the UK and US “Do not have a five year plan to take economic domination.” Marvell and Samsung are extending their collaboration to encompass infrastructure across additional segments of the radio access network (RAN). The companies have collaborated on baseband and transport processing solutions for base stations based on Marvell’s Octeon and Octeon Fusion processors. In addition, the companies are collaborating on radio unit architectures designed to meet the compute power required for the beamforming algorithms inherent to massive MIMO deployments. With Coronavirus causing concern, we thought it might be instructive to see how the industry was affected by SARS back in 2003. Here’s the analysis we wrote then: While SARS is dealing devastating blows to service industry in China, its damage to the electronics industry in the country appears to be limited in the short-term. Long-term, however, huge question marks remain. The most disruptive part is at the moment is that most companies have put on hold all business trips and are reducing face-to-face meetings.Xerox has made a tender offer direct to HP’s shareholders to buy all HP’s shares for $24 per share, comprising $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share, valuing HP at nearly $35 billion.

"“This technology can safely guide a drone to a desired location without any sudden change in direction in emergency situations,” according to national research university KAIST.Spoof GPS signals have been tried before, according to KAIST, but can push the drone into what the team describes as ‘GPS safety mode’ – various emergency fail-safe modes, that differ between manufacturers, intended to promote drone safety when GPS signals are judged to be unreliable in some way – leading, for example, to the drone freezing in position and continuing to disrupt an airport.Led by electrical engineer Professor Yongdae Kim, the KAIST team analysed what put various drones into a GPS safety mode and what switched them back to GPS navigation, and from this designed a drone abduction technique that “covers almost all the types of drone GPS safety modes, and is universally applicable to any drone that uses GPS regardless of model or manufacturer”, said the university.“Conventional consumer drones equipped with GPS safety mode seem to be safe from fake GPS signals, however, most of these drones are able to be detoured since they detect GPS errors in a rudimentary manner,” said Kim.The method is detailed in ‘‘, a paper in ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security.According to the paper, after software simulations and field tests on four drones ( DJI Phantom 3 Standard, DJI Phantom 4, Parrot Bebop 2, 3DR Solo) “the strategies can force them to move in any direction with high accuracy”.Photos:The team (from top right clockwise): Professor Yongdae Kim, Yujin Kwon, Juhwan Noh, Hocheol Shin, and Dohyun Kim.The test set-up: Spoof GPS signal produced by the PC are sent to the drone by  directional antenna.",A safe way to bring down rogue drones,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/safe-way-bring-rogue-drones-2019-07/

"The novel substrate is there to allow rigid pixels to be incorporated. “Traditional intrinsically stretchable OLEDs have commercial limitations due to their low efficiency in the electrical conductivity of the electrodes,” according to KAIST. “In addition, previous geometrically stretchable OLEDs laminated to the elastic substrates with thin film devices lead to different pixel emissions of the devices from different peak sizes of the buckles.”To side-step these issues, there are actually two substrates.The upper substrate starts off rigid and is carved away leaving each pixel as a rigid island connected to its neighbours by thin serpentine bridges that are curved enough to be flexible.All of this is connected to and supported by the underlying stretchy substrate using elastic micro-pillars – so a patterned upper substrate with bridges makes the rigid substrate stretchable, while the pillars decentralise the stress on the device.“Although various applications using micro-pillar arrays have been reported, it has not yet been reported how elastic pillar arrays can affect substrates by relieving the stress applied to those substrates upon stretching,” said KAIST. “Compared to results using similar layouts with conventional free-standing, flat substrates or island structures, their [the team’s] results with elastic pillar arrays show relatively low stress levels at both the bridges and plates when stretching the devices.”The result is small stretchable OLED display, with the OLEDs patterned by thermal evaporation fabrication onto the stress-relief substrate.“Our substrate design will impart flexibility into electronics technology development including semiconductor and circuit technologies. We look forward this stretchable OLED lowering the barrier for entering the stretchable display market,” said team leader Professor Kyung Cheol Choi.The work is published in Nano Letters as ‘‘.",Updated: Stretchable OLED display proof-of-concept from KAIST,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/research-news/stretchable-oled-display-proof-concept-kaist-2020-03/

"In an invited paper, MediaTek described the technological challenges of developing automotive surround-view radar systems for 360° proximity sensing for vehicles, concentrating on a 79GHz FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous-wave) radar transceiver, plus DSP, that it has fitten into a 16 x 25mm.Then Uhnder of Austin Texas described a 77/79GHz MIMO (multple-input antennas multiple-output antennas) radar SoC with 12 transmitters and 8×2 receivers, allowing 92 virtual receivers to be created. The resulting radar, in a 28nm CMOS IC, has 60mm range resolution, 1° angular resolution and 0.099km/h speed resolution from Doppler measurements.Belgian research lab Imec, with Delft University of Technology and Eindhoven University of Technology, were there to talk about a UWB (ultra-wide-band) radar for occupancy and vital sign detection which can measure heart rate at 5m range and respiration at 15m, while consuming an astonishingly low 680μW. Apparently burst-chirp operation and time-domain pre-distortion is responsible for a 100x power reduction from earlier attempts – chirp slope is fast at 0.7GHz/40ms with a 0.5MHzrms.Imec always features heavily at ISSCC – it is world-class in chip making technology, chip design and end-application development. In the RF transceiver session it also presented a second paper – this time on a 28nm CMOS transceiver front-end with integrated antennas for 145GHz FMCW radars. The transmitter has a peak effective isotropic radiated power of 11dBm with a 3dB bandwidth of 127 to 154GHz. The receiver has an effective isotropic noise figure of 6dB and a 3dB bandwidth of 138 to 151GHz.Hiroshima University, the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communication Technology and Panasonic have been working together on a short-range 300GHz data transceiver in 40nm CMOS, which was revealed at the conference – which has achieved 80Gbit/s over 30mm using a pair of transceiver ICs with 24dBi horn antennas.Intel was there with a 60GHz digital polar transmitter with on-chip pulse shaping. Built on 28nm CMOS, and using an on-PCB dual polariation antenna, it  transmits spectrally-shaped 28.2Gbit/s data with 5.6dBm average power and -21.3dBm EVM while consuming 136mW.And Intel was another organisation with two papers – the second of its describing a 71-76GHz 64-element phased-array with a direct-conversion 2×2 transceiver in 22nm finfet CMOS – said to be the first demonstration of a phased-array in finfet technology. It uses four ICs in a module that includes 16 patch antennas, with four of these modules tiled on a PCB to reach 64-elements. The final array has a measured EVM of -20dB for 7.2Gbit/s 16QAM at 35dBm effective isotropic radiated power.Finally in the session, Korean research lab KAIST teamed up with Hanbat National University to present a 28GHz beam-forming front-end in 65nm CMOS. It has 6bit phase control with 1.5°rms phase error, and 16dB gain control range with 1.4° peak phase variation. The transmitter has a P1dB of 13.9dBm and a peak efficiency of 20.3%, and the receiver has a 4.58dB noise figure.Held once a year in San Francisco, the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) is the the world’s showcase for innovative and cunning chip design. By inviting papers, and accepting others, the IEEE achieves a glorious spread of technology from companies and universities from all regions in the world where semiconductors are designed.  is the foremost global forum for presentation of advances in solid-state circuits and systems-on-a-chip.",ISSCC: Transceivers for radar and communication,https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/design/isscc-transceivers-radar-communication-2019-02/
