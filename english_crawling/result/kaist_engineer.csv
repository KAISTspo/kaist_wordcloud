"Developed at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), the 25kg Mole-bot is proposed as tool for space exploration and mining for resources such as coalbed methane and Rare Earth Elements, which require highly advanced drilling technologies.“The crushing power of the African mole-rat’s teeth is so powerful that they can dig a hole with 48 times more power than their body weight. We used this characteristic for building the main excavation tool. And its expandable drill is designed not to collide with its forelimbs,” said Prof Hyun Myung from KAIST’s School of Electrical Engineering.According to , the 25cm wide and 84cm long Mole-bot can excavate three times faster with six times higher directional accuracy than conventional models.After digging, the robot removes the excavated soil and debris using its forelimbs. This embedded muscle feature, inspired by the European mole’s scapula, converts linear motion into a powerful rotational force. For directional drilling, the robot’s elongated waist changes its direction 360° like living mammals.For exploring underground environments, the research team developed and applied new sensor systems and algorithms to identify the robot’s position and orientation using graph-based 3D Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technology that matches the Earth’s magnetic field sequence, which enables 3D autonomous navigation underground.According to Market & Market’s survey, the directional drilling market is expected to grow to $103bn in 2021. The growth of the drilling market is likely to expand further into the future development of space and polar resources.The Mole-bot is claimed to be step forward for efficient underground drilling and exploration technologies. Unlike conventional drilling processes that use environmentally unfriendly mud compounds for cleaning debris, Mole-bot can mitigate environmental damage. The researchers said in a statement that their system saves on cost and labour and does not require additional pipelines or other ancillary equipment.“We look forward to a more efficient resource exploration with this type of drilling robot. We also hope Mole-bot will have a very positive impact on the robotics market in terms of its extensive application spectra and economic feasibility,” said Prof Myung.",Biomimetic Mole-bot set to drill in complex environments,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/mole-bot-drilling-kaist/
"The team at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) said their waste-to-resource approach tackles food waste and electronics waste, supporting the development of a circular economy.In a statement, Professor Madhavi Srinivasan, co-director of the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (NTU SCARCE) lab, said: “Current industrial recycling processes of e-waste are energy-intensive and emit harmful pollutants and liquid waste, pointing to an urgent need for eco-friendly methods as the amount of e-waste grows. Our team has demonstrated that it is possible to do so with biodegradable substances.”The findings were published in in July.With industrial approaches to recycling battery waste generating harmful pollutants, hydrometallurgy – using water as a solvent for extraction – is increasingly being explored as a possible alternative. This process involves first shredding and crushing used batteries to form a crushed material called black mass. Researchers then extract valuable metals from black mass by dissolving it in a mix of strong acids or weak acids plus other chemicals like hydrogen peroxide under heat, before letting the metals precipitate.While relatively more eco-friendly than conventional methods, the use of such strong chemicals on an industrial scale could generate a substantial amount of secondary pollutants.The NTU team found that the combination of orange peel that has been oven-dried and ground into powder, plus citric acid, can achieve the same goal.In lab experiments, the team found that their approach extracted around 90 per cent of cobalt, lithium, nickel, and manganese from spent lithium-ion batteries, which they said is a comparable efficacy to the approach using hydrogen peroxide.Assistant Professor Dalton Tay of the NTU School of Materials Science and Engineering and School of Biological Sciences said: “The key lies in the cellulose found in orange peel, which is converted into sugars under heat during the extraction process. These sugars enhance the recovery of metals from battery waste. Naturally-occurring antioxidants found in orange peel, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, could have contributed to this enhancement as well.”Solid residues generated from this process were found to be non-toxic, suggesting that this method is environmentally sound, he added.From the recovered materials, they then assembled new lithium-ion batteries, which showed a similar charge capacity to commercial ones. Further research is underway to optimise the charge-discharge cycling performance of these new batteries made from recovered materials.",Orange peel helps to recycle lithium-ion batteries,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/orange-peel-recycle-lithium-ion-batteries-ntu-singapore/
"The advance is claimed to be a major step toward a circular carbon economy and could help efforts to reverse global warming. The study has been published in “We set out to develop an effective catalyst that can convert large amounts of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane without failure,” said Cafer T. Yavuz, paper author and associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and of chemistry at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology).The catalyst is made from nickel, magnesium, and molybdenum and initiates and speeds up the rate of reaction that converts carbon dioxide and methane into hydrogen. The team said it can work efficiently for over a month.This dry reforming process converts gases such as carbon dioxide into more useful chemicals that could be refined for use in fuel, plastics, or pharmaceuticals. It is an effective process, but it previously required rare and expensive metals such as platinum and rhodium to induce a brief and inefficient chemical reaction.Other researchers had proposed nickel as a more economical solution, but carbon by-products would build up and the surface nanoparticles would bind together on the cheaper metal, fundamentally changing the composition and geometry of the catalyst and rendering it useless.“The difficulty arises from the lack of control on scores of active sites over the bulky catalysts surfaces because any refinement procedures attempted also change the nature of the catalyst itself,” Yavuz said in a statement.The researchers said they produced nickel-molybdenum nanoparticles under a reductive environment in the presence of a single crystalline magnesium oxide. As the ingredients were heated under reactive gas, the nanoparticles moved on the pristine crystal surface seeking anchoring points. The resulting activated catalyst sealed its own high-energy active sites and permanently fixed the location of the nanoparticles, so the nickel-based catalyst will not have a carbon build-up, nor will the surface particles bind to one another.“It took us almost a year to understand the underlying mechanism,” said first author Youngdong Song, a graduate student in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at KAIST. “Once we studied all the chemical events in detail, we were shocked.”The researchers dubbed the catalyst Nanocatalysts on Single Crystal Edges (NOSCE). The magnesium-oxide nanopowder comes from a finely structured form of magnesium oxide, where the molecules bind continuously to the edge. There are no breaks or defects in the surface, allowing for uniform and predictable reactions.“Our study solves a number of challenges the catalyst community faces,” Yavuz said. “We believe the NOSCE mechanism will improve other inefficient catalytic reactions and provide even further savings of greenhouse gas emissions.”",KAIST catalyst ‘major step to carbon circular economy’,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/kaist-catalyst-recycles-greenhouse-gases/
"AI and robotics researchers have ended a boycott of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology over the opening of an AI weapons lab in collaboration with Hanwha Systems.At the opening of the Research Centre for the Convergence of National Defence and Artificial Intelligence, it was reported that KAIST was joining the global competition to develop autonomous arms by developing weapons that could search for and eliminate targets without human control.“KAIST does not have any intention to engage in development of lethal autonomous weapons systems and killer robots,” said KAIST’s president, Professor Sung-Chul Shin, in response to the boycott. “KAIST will not conduct any research activities counter to human dignity including autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control.”Boycott instigator Toby Walsh, Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said: “There are plenty of good applications for AI, even in a military setting.“No one, for instance, should risk a life or limb clearing a minefield – this is a perfect job for a robot. But we should not, however, hand over the decision of who lives or who dies to a machine – this crosses an ethical red-line and will result in new weapons of mass destruction.”The boycott arose ahead of meetings this week in Geneva of the 123 member nations of the United Nations discussing the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons. The Group of Governmental Experts to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons will consider military applications of AI, and options for addressing the humanitarian and international security challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons systems.“Back in 2015, thousands of my colleagues in AI  to develop autonomous weapons,” Walsh said. “We couldn’t therefore sit back and watch a top university collaborate with such a controversial industry partner to accelerate that race.",AI and robotics researchers call off boycott of KAIST,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/ai-robotics-kaist/
"The breakthrough, made by a team at the , relates to the development of a simple method for creating multi-layered liquid crystals that could be used as the basis tweaking the optical characteristics of materials.When a special additive called chiral dopant is mixed with the liquid crystal material commonly used in display devices, the liquid crystal molecules rotate spontaneously to form a spiral structure known as “cholesteric liquid crystal.” This material can exhibit colour without the addition of pigments. An additional property known as circular polarisation means that it’s possible to make colours appear and disappear by changing certain polarisation conditions.The KIST team has developed a method to produce materials consisting of several layers of cholesteric liquid crystal, enabling the development of materials that can exhibit two or more different characteristics at the same time.To achieve this, they added a cosolvent that dissolved in both oil and water as a way to mix organic alcohol, a hydrophilic moisturising agent, and the hydrophobic liquid crystal material for all three substances to become evenly mixed together.This mixture was then emulsified in water to form microemulsion drops. With the exchanges occurring among the cosolvent, moisturising agent, and water molecules through the surfaces of the emulsion drops, this resulted in a separation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers.Depending on the initial mixing ratio of the substances, they separated into multiple layers ranging from one to five, and these layers could be freely controlled.Also, with the phase separation occurring continually within each emulsion drop, the concentration of the chiral dopant inside the liquid crystals changed, resulting in multiple structural colours.",Korean team develops forgery-proof liquid crystal material,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/korean-liquid-crystal-material/
"Demand for face masks in South Korea has led to the nation’s government rationing them to two per person per week. The face masks most commonly used are disposable N94 and N95 types that were made for filtering up to 95 per cent of fine dust.A  (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) research has now developed a nano-filter that is claimed to maintain filtering efficiency, even after hand washing, through the development of proprietary technology that aligns nanofibres with a diameter of 100~500nm in orthogonal or unidirectional directions. The team believe the reusable nano-filtered face mask could help relieve the challenges arising from shortages of face masks.Professor Il-Doo Kim’s nano-fibre filtered mask is said to maintain its frame and filtering function even after being washed more than 20 times. Professor Kim, who has continued to study the filtering of fine dust using nano-filters, is now awaiting final approval from South Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to bring his product to market.Professor Kim used an insulation block electrospinning process to manufacture orthogonal nanofibres by controlling the alignment of nanofibres. This structure can minimise delivering of the pressure toward the air filter and maximise the filtration efficiency, which is different from existing disposable masks without nano-fibres.According to KAIST, existing masks also fail to maintain their air filtering function because their electrostatic function disappears when exposed to water. The nano-fibre design was proven to be water-resistant with more than 94 per cent filtering efficiency in 20 repeated bactericidal tests with ethanol. The nano-filter mask also showed no deformation in its nano-membrane structure despite the 20 hand washes. In particular, it was confirmed that there were no deformations in the membrane, even after soaking in ethanol more than three hours.“We believe that this mask can be reusable for about a month even after washing in ethanol,” Professor Kim said in a statement. “The inner filter can also be replaced. We found that the mask filters out up to 80 per cent of 600nm particles even after undergoing a bending test more than 4,000 times.”In February Professor Kim established the Kim Il-Doo Research Institute, a start-up that currently produces 1,500 nano-filters per day.",Nano-filter extends life of masks worn to avoid coronavirus,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/kaist-nano-filter-face-masks/

We can see prototypes of autonomous weapons under development today by many nations including the US, China, Russia and the UK. We are locked into an arms race that no one wants to happen. KAIST’s actions will only accelerate this arms race.

"The researchers from the University of California San Diego detail their work in .“Essentially, we recreated all the key features that squids use for high-speed swimming,” said Michael T. Tolley, one of the paper’s senior authors and a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego. “This is the first untethered robot that can generate jet pulses for rapid locomotion like the squid and can achieve these jet pulses by changing its body shape, which improves swimming efficiency.”This squid robot is composed mainly of soft materials such as acrylic polymer, plus a few rigid, 3D printed and laser cut parts. Soft robots in underwater exploration can protect fish and coral but they tend to move slowly and have difficulty manoeuvring. This prompted the research team to look at cephalopods to solve some of these issues. In particular, squid can reach the fastest speeds of any aquatic invertebrates due to a jet propulsion mechanism.According to UC San Diego, the team’s robot takes a volume of water into its body while storing elastic energy in its skin and flexible ribs. It then releases this energy by compressing its body and generates a jet of water to propel itself.At rest, the squid robot is shaped roughly like a paper lantern, and has flexible ribs, which act like springs, along its sides. The ribs are connected to two circular plates at each end of the robot. One of them is connected to a nozzle that both takes in water and ejects it when the robot’s body contracts. The other plate can carry a water-proof camera or a different type of sensor.Engineers first tested the squid robot in a water testbed in the lab of Professor Geno Pawlak, in the UC San Diego Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. It was then tested in a tank at the UC San Diego Birch Aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.They demonstrated that the robot could steer by adjusting the direction of the nozzle and recorded its speed at about 18 to 32cm per second, which is faster than most other soft robots.“After we were able to optimise the design of the robot so that it would swim in a tank in the lab, it was especially exciting to see that the robot was able to successfully swim in a large aquarium among coral and fish, demonstrating its feasibility for real-world applications,” said Caleb Christianson, who led the study as part of his Ph.D. work in Tolley’s research group.",Untethered squid robot could help study coral reefs,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/squid-robot-underwater-exploration-water/
"Researchers, publishing in , believe the device can accelerate efforts to uncover brain diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, addiction, depression, and pain.The device, using Lego-like replaceable drug cartridges and Bluetooth low-energy, can target specific neurons of interest using drug and light for prolonged periods.“The wireless neural device enables chronic chemical and optical neuromodulation that has never been achieved before,” said lead author Raza Qazi, a researcher with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and University of Colorado Boulder.In a statement, Qazi said this technology overshadows conventional methods used by neuroscientists, which often involve rigid metal tubes and optical fibres to deliver drugs and light. Apart from limiting the subject’s movement because of the physical connections with the equipment, their relatively rigid structure eventually causes lesion in soft brain tissue, making them unsuitable for long-term implantation.To mitigate against this, efforts have been made to incorporate soft probes and wireless platforms, but these solutions have been limited by their inability to deliver drugs for long periods of time and their bulky and complex control setups.To achieve chronic wireless drug delivery, scientists had to solve the dual challenge of exhaustion and evaporation of drugs. Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of Washington in Seattle collaborated to invent a neural device with a replaceable drug cartridge, which could allow neuroscientists to study the same brain circuits for several months without worrying about running out of drugs.These ‘plug-n-play’ drug cartridges were assembled into a brain implant for mice with a soft and ultrathin probe – which consisted of microfluidic channels and tiny LEDs – for unlimited drug doses and light delivery.Controlled with a user interface on a smartphone, neuroscientists can trigger any specific combination or precise sequencing of light and drug deliveries in any implanted target animal without the need to be inside the laboratory. Using these wireless neural devices, researchers could also easily set up fully automated animal studies where behaviour of one animal could positively or negatively affect behaviour in other animals by conditional triggering of light and/or drug delivery.“This revolutionary device is the fruit of advanced electronics design and powerful micro and nanoscale engineering,” said Jae-Woong Jeong, a professor of electrical engineering at KAIST. “We are interested in further developing this technology to make a brain implant for clinical applications.”Michael Bruchas, a professor of anaesthesiology and pain medicine and pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, said this technology will help researchers in many ways.“It allows us to better dissect the neural circuit basis of behaviour, and how specific neuromodulators in the brain tune behaviour in various ways,” he said. “We are also eager to use the device for complex pharmacological studies, which could help us develop new therapeutics for pain, addiction, and emotional disorders.”",Smartphone controls therapeutic brain implants,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/brain-implants-smartphone/

"In recent weeks, Google cancelled its contract with the US Department of defence to develop a machine vision system known as Project Maven, which would analyse imagery captured by military drones to detect vehicles and other objects, track their motion and provide data to the military. The company’s employees signed en masse a letter to the company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, stating that such a project would outsource the moral responsibility for the application of their work to a third party, and that they were not prepared to countenance Google or its contractors building what they referred to as “warfare technology”.Google’s repositioning is not the first example of pressure being applied to stop AI from being developed for military applications.  reported in April that a group of academics had threatened to boycott the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) if it were to develop autonomous weapons that could locate and eliminate targets without human control.

Of these, a clear majority – 57 per cent – took the pragmatic view that AI will inevitably be used in war and that defences are needed. Notably, 18 per cent said that it was always immoral to use AI offensively, and a similar number – 16 per cent – said that AI should be classed with chemical and biological weapons. The smallest proportion of respondents – 9 per cent – declined to pick one of our options.The comment section was typically lively, with 21 contributions. Many of these took issue with the composition of the poll, complaining that it asked the wrong question or that the options were inadequate. A typical response came from Tony Scales: “What is meant by ‘AI Technologies’? Types of AI tech are already in the game and have been for years. We need a more ‘intelligent’ debate about what constitutes AI tech and how it can, may, has, should be & should not be used. AI is easily conflated with autonomous systems.” Toby Walsh said: “This is a terrible poll. It asks the wrong question. There is a global campaign to ban lethal autonomous weapons without meaningful human control. But no one of the options in the poll lets you support that AI can be used by military but only provided there is meaningful human control.”Of the more constructive comments, Ian Buglass noted: “AI is/has already been weaponised. That particular horse has bolted, and the stable door has fallen off its hinges. The knowledge, the raw information and the hardware to implement weaponised AI is already freely available. It’s only a matter of time before the less desirable elements present in our midst catch on to the fact that they can further their own ends with tenfold efficiency using published research results.”Roger Twelvetrees added: “There is already a fair amount of what could be described as AI in sea mines and “fire and forget” missiles, and I don’t expect that developments of those systems will cease, so development of AI for weapons will inevitably continue.”A reader using the name 1st  Watch noted: “Of course we should develop them and aim to be at the fore of their development. If we don’t act proactively possible rogues will certainly develop them AND will probably use them, leaving us at a definite disadvantage should we be attacked.” Chris Elliott pointed out that there is a positive side to robot soldiers: “Robots don’t get angry and commit warcrimes because they saw their mates blown up by an IED yesterday.

"The team at  have developed what is described as a flexible but sturdy wearable piezoelectric harvester using a process of hot pressing and tape casting.A research team led by Professor Seungbum Hong said that the novelty of this result lies in its simplicity, applicability, durability, and its new characterisation of embedded wearable electronic devices.Wearable devices are increasingly used in a wide array of applications from small electronics to embedded devices such as sensors, actuators, displays, and energy harvesters.Despite their many advantages, high costs and complex fabrication processes remained challenges for reaching commercialisation. In addition, their durability was frequently questioned. To address these issues, Professor Hong’s team developed a new fabrication process and analysis technology for testing the mechanical properties of affordable wearable devices.For this process, the research team used a hot pressing and tape casting procedure to connect the fabric structures of polyester and a polymer film. Hot pressing has usually been used when making batteries and fuel cells due to its high adhesiveness. The process is also quick, taking two to three minutes.According to KAIST, the newly developed fabrication process will enable the direct application of a device into general garments using hot pressing just as graphic patches can be attached to garments using a heat press.When the polymer film is hot pressed onto a fabric below its crystallisation temperature, it transforms into an amorphous state. In this state, it compactly attaches to the concave surface of the fabric and infiltrates into the gaps between the transverse wefts and longitudinal warps. These features result in high interfacial adhesion strength. For this reason, hot pressing has the potential to reduce the cost of fabrication through the direct application of fabric-based wearable devices to common garments.In addition to the conventional durability test of bending cycles, the newly introduced surface and interfacial cutting analysis system proved the high mechanical durability of the fabric-based wearable device by measuring the high interfacial adhesion strength between the fabric and the polymer film. Professor Hong said the study lays a new foundation for the manufacturing process and analysis of wearable devices using fabrics and polymers.He added that his team first used the surface and interfacial cutting analysis system (SAICAS) in the field of wearable electronics to test the mechanical properties of polymer-based wearable devices. Their surface and interfacial cutting analysis system is more precise than conventional methods (peel test, tape test, and microstretch test) because it qualitatively and quantitatively measures the adhesion strength.The team’s findings have been published in ",Hot pressing and tape casting key to embedded wearable devices,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/hot-pressing-tape-casting-embedded-wearable-devices/

"A team working under Prof Jae-Woong Jeong from the School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST invented the multifunctional electronic platform that can mechanically transform its shape, flexibility, and stretchability. Reported in the platform us claimed to allow usersto precisely tune its stiffness and shape.“This new class of electronics will not only offer robust, convenient interfaces for use in both tabletop or handheld setups, but also allow seamless integration with the skin when applied onto our bodies,” Prof Jeong said in a statement.The transformative electronics consist of a gallium metal structure, hermetically encapsulated and sealed within a soft silicone material, combined with electronics that are designed to be flexible and stretchable. The mechanical transformation of the electronic systems is specifically triggered by temperature changes that are controlled by the user.“Gallium is an interesting key material. It is biocompatible, has high rigidity in solid form, and melts at a temperature comparable to the skin’s temperature,” said lead author Sang-Hyuk Byun, a researcher at KAIST.Once the transformative electronic platform comes in contact with a human body, the gallium encapsulated inside the silicone changes to a liquid state and softens the whole electronic structure, making it stretchable, flexible, and wearable. The gallium then solidifies again once the structure is peeled off the skin, making the electronic circuits stiff and stable.“This technology could not have been achieved without interdisciplinary efforts,” said co-lead author Joo Yong Sim, who is a researcher with ETRI. “We worked together with electrical, mechanical, and biomedical engineers, as well as material scientists and neuroscientists to make this breakthrough.”This universal electronics platform allowed researchers to demonstrate applications that were highly adaptable and customisable, such as a multi-purpose personal electronics with variable stiffness and stretchability, a pressure sensor with tuneable bandwidth and sensitivity, and a neural probe that softens upon implantation into brain tissue.",Transformative electronics reconfigure into wearables,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/transformative-reconfigure-wearable/

"Researchers at Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a new type of aqueous energy storage device that they claim can be charged in less than half a minute.Employing aqueous electrolytes instead of flammable organic solvents, the device is claimed to enable a boosting charge with high energy density, potentially making it suitable for a range of portable electronic devices.According to the group, which was headed up by Prof Jeung Ku Kang from the Graduate School of Energy, Environment, Water, and Sustainability the system owes its performance to a design that assembles fibre-like polymer chain anodes and sub-nanoscale metal oxide cathodes on graphene.Conventional aqueous electrolyte-based energy storage devices have a limitation for boosting charges and high energy density due to low driving voltage and a shortage of anode materials.Energy storage device capacity is determined by the two electrodes, and the balance between cathode and anode leads to high stability. In general, two electrodes show differences in electrical properties and differ in ion storage mechanism processes, resulting in poor storage and stability from the imbalance.The research team came up with new structures and materials to facilitate rapid speed in energy exchange on the surfaces of the electrodes and minimise the energy loss between the two electrodes.The team made anodes with graphene-based polymer chain materials. The web-like structure of graphene leads to a high surface area, thereby allowing higher capacitance.For cathode materials, the team used metal oxide in sub-nanoscale structures to elevate atom-by-ion redox reactions. This method realised higher energy density and faster energy exchange while minimising energy loss.The device can be charged within 20 to 30 seconds using a low-power charging system, such as a USB switching charger or a flexible photovoltaic cell.Prof Kang said: “This eco-friendly technology can be easily manufactured and is highly applicable. In particular, its high capacity and high stability, compared to existing technologies, could contribute to the commercialisation of aqueous capacitors. The device can be rapidly charged using a low-power charging system, and thus can be applied to portable electronic device.”The group’s aqueous energy storage work was reported in the journal ",Aqueous energy storage device promises rapid charging of portable electronics,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/aqueous-energy-storage/
"The concept relies on a turtle’s instinctive behaviour to move towards light. By attaching a black semi-cylinder with a small opening to the turtle’s back, the animal’s movement could be guided by blocking its vision in a particular direction. To do so using human thoughts, the team proposes a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can translate brainwaves into commands which move the opening in the cylinder, thereby controlling the turtle.As well as the semi-cylinder to guide movements, the turtle’s ‘cyborg’ system would include a Wi-Fi transceiver, a Raspberry-Pi computer control module, a battery and a camera, all attached to the animal’s shell. Real-time images from the camera would be fed to a head-mounted display (HMD) worn by the human controller.According to the researchers, the BCI would use electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the human to distinguish between three mental states: left, right and idle. Left and right signals would be sent by WiFi to control the semi-cylinder, obstructing the turtle’s view and guiding its instinctive movement toward the light from the slit, which could be turned ±36 degrees via the BCI.The team says the technology could be developed to integrate positioning systems and improved augmented and virtual reality techniques. Potential applications include devices for military reconnaissance and surveillance.",Proposed system to control turtles with brainwaves,https://www.theengineer.co.uk/proposed-system-to-control-turtles-with-brainwaves/
