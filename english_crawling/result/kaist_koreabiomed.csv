"A joint research team, led by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), has developed technology to culture the Covid-19 virus in human alveoli created three-dimensionally in laboratories.The success will help to explain Covid-19’s infection mechanism and develop treatments, KAIST said in a news release Monday.    According to Worldometer, an international site providing real-time statistics, the cumulative Covid-19 caseload worldwide topped 43.3 million as of Sunday, exceeded the 40 million landmark set on Oct. 18 in a week, showing signs of a second wave.A model that simulates the human body usable in a laboratory is essential in developing a therapeutic agent based on an accurate understanding of disease mechanisms. However, related studies had run into limits, as researchers had difficulty infecting mice with Covid-19, and there were no available human alveoli to use in laboratories.The joint research team has newly developed a 3D human alveolar model that can be continuously cultured. The model has made possible the study of the disease mechanisms of various respiratory viruses, including the Covid-19, using human lung cells in a laboratory. Researchers can also directly apply it to the development of treatments such as drug screening, according to the KAIST.The research team found the conditions for stable and long-term 3D cultivation of human lung tissue obtained from surgical test materials. When the 3D alveoli were exposed to the Covid-19 virus, rapid proliferation occurred within six hours and completed infection. Still, the activation of the innate immune response of the lung took about three days.“If we can expand the scale of the 3D human lung culture model, it will be useful for studying the infection mechanisms of various respiratory viruses, including the Covid-19,” said Joo Young-seok, a professor of KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering. “Researchers can use the model to reveal mechanisms and develop medicine by using human lung cells in infectious disease studies.”National Research Foundation of Korea, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul National University College of Medicine, European Research Council, Suh Kyungbae Foundation, and the Human Frontier Science Program supported the study.The study, titled “Three-dimensional human alveolar stem cell culture models reveal infection response to SARS-CoV-2,” was published in the online edition of the journal, Cell Stem Cell last Thursday.",Researchers develop 3D alveoli-culturing tech to find Covid-19 infection mechanism,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9473
"A research team composed of two local universities -- Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungbuk National University College of Medicine (CNUCM) -- has developed a vaccine for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus infection.SFTS is a contagious disease caused by virus-infected wild ticks. The disease leads to severe fever after six to 14 days of incubation and causes various illnesses, including platelet and white blood cell reduction, vomiting and diarrhea. In severe cases, SFTS can also lead to death. In Korea, the number of SFTS patients has been steadily increasing every year since the nation saw its first patient in 2013. Currently, there are no vaccines that treat the disease.The team, led by Professors Park Soo-young of KAIST and Choi Young-ki of CNUCM, designed the vaccine antigen by deriving a common sequence from the gene sequences of 31 different SFTS viruses. It then used Geneone Life Science’s technology to make a DNA vaccine. Unlike conventional vaccines, DNA vaccines have the advantage of using only genes to induce a safe and broad immune response.The researchers found that the vaccine suppressed infection in the infected animal model and saw none of the usual symptoms, such as digestive symptoms, platelet, and leukocyte reduction.“The vaccine is the first drug that would perfectly protect against SFTS virus infection and demonstrated complete protection against a non-mouse model, which portrayed the same infection route as a human model,” Professor Park said.Professor Choi said, “The research result of the development of the SFTS vaccine is significant as we have secured a technological advantage for the development of SFTS vaccines worldwide.”The team plans to continue its research to commercialize the SFTS virus vaccine, Choi added.The result of the research was published in the Aug. 23 online edition of the Nature Communications.",University researchers develop vaccine for severe fever with SFTS infection,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6367
"Researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) and Hanyang University have found a new anticancer principle that tempts cancer cells to die on their own.Disturbing cell ions is one of the strategies to inhibit essential cell functions. The function is also one of the main strategies used in anticancer drugs. However, the clinical applicability of disturbing cell ions was low as the strategy had certain limitations such as low solubility.To resolve the problem, the team, led by Professors Kim Yoo-chun at KAIST and Yoon Chae-ok at Hanyang University, discovered an alpha-helical peptide-based anticancer substance, which is water-soluble but has potassium (K) ion transport capability.“The key is to combine a water-friendly group and a potassium ion transportable group with cationic nature at the end of the peptide,” the team said. “The new anticancer peptide lowers intracellular potassium concentration and increases intracellular calcium (Ca) concentration.”The intracellular calcium concentration increase also helps to boost active oxygen concentration and cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, which ultimately leads cells to cause self-destruction, it added.The researchers have confirmed that the substance is effective in inhibiting cancer growth through an animal experiment.“Our team expects that the new principle will be able to replace existing cancer therapy limitations as it can kill cancer cells,” Professor Kim said.The results of the research were selected as the back cover in the July edition of Advanced Science.",KAIST-Hanyang University team presents new anticancer principle,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6213
"The Korean government said it would spend 25.8 billion won ($21.7 million) on supporting the discovery and development of innovative medicines using artificial intelligence (AI) in the next three years.The Ministry of Science and ICT and the Ministry of Health and Welfare plan to use the money for operating six research teams and management institutions composed of experts in big data, AI and new drug development.The project focuses on building a customized AI platform for each phase of new drug development, including the discovery of candidate substances and clinical trials. The three leading areas -- discovering candidate agents, recreating new drugs, and smart drug monitoring -- are expected to produce the best results of technology development, the government said.For AI-powered drug candidate discovery, AI-using drug development startup Arontier, Chung-Ang University, Daegu Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, and Ewha Woman's University will conduct a study to develop an AI platform.The state project also includes research support for recreating new drugs, which could reduce costs by skipping safety verification that had been already proven through trials and regulatory reviews.To build a platform for recreation of new drugs, a KAIST research team plans to develop a deep learning model that replicates the existing mechanism of drug actions and conduct verification tests.To improve the drug monitoring system which used to be possible only after the release of a pharmaceutical product, Asan Medical Center will build a system to predict adverse drug reactions using machine learning of big data on immunotherapies.The government expects that a successful implementation of the project could reduce the average time for new drug development by half from 15 years to seven years.The government will open up the developed platform later so that researchers and companies can use it freely. After the project closure, research institutes will own the platform to keep it updated and applied well.",￦25.8 billion earmarked for AI-driven drug discovery,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=5924

"Noh Moon-jong, CEO of Kolon TissueGene, is the key person to clarify why Invossa-K contained abnormal GP2-293 cells because he has been heading the early-stage research on the gene therapy for osteoarthritis. However, he has kept silent about the issue for over three weeks since the suspension of the drug sales.Kolon Life Science has not given out a full explanation of why Invossa’s second ingredient of transduced cells contained 293 cells to date.Kolon Life Science CEO Lee Woo-sok and Managing Director Kim Soo-jung said at a news conference on Thursday last week that “it was unlikely that 293 cells were not filtered out.”Some of the filters might have been torn, or other things may have contaminated the drug cell. However, these are all speculations, and the company is investigating the researchers who worked at the time, Lee said.Lee said it was difficult to identify the cause of the problem because all the researchers who worked on Invossa at Kolon TissueGene left the company, except for one person.Kolon TissueGene mainly developed the early-stage substances for Invossa, and the team came from Kolon’s central research lab. The research team successfully developed cells to make them secrete TGF-β. Then, the team set up Kolon TissueGene in the U.S. to build the master cell bank to commercialize the cell gene therapy.In Korea, Kolon Life Science sought approval for clinical trials and marketing license based on the cell lines developed by Kolon TissueGene.Kolon Life Science’s R&D head Yoo Soo-hyun, Managing Director Kim, and Managing Director Choi Heon-sik joined Kolon Life Science after 2010. In other words, researchers at Kolon TissueGene may have the answer to solve the Invossa problem.Among them, TissueGene’s CTO Noh is the only researcher who still works at the company. Leading Kolon TissueGene’s R&D and clinical trials, Noh has been recently appointed as CEO after former CEO Lee Bum-sup abruptly resigned.Kolon Life Science CEO Lee told reporters that “no person was remaining at TissueGene who was involved in building the cell line in 2003. However, Noh, who led the early development of Invossa, is still working at TissueGeneNoh graduated from Seoul National University’s Microbiology Department, received Ph.D. in Life Science at KAIST, and entered Kolon Life Science.He researched Invossa as the head of the life science research team at Kolon’s central research institute, jointly with a research team at Inha University led by professor Lee Kwan-hee in the mid-1990s.As the joint research team successfully developed the drug candidate for Invossa, Noh’s name was registered as the inventor of the patent.Even though Noh is the only person within Kolon TissueGen who knows the best why the cell ingredients were mislabeled, he has not mentioned any word on the issue. Noh is reportedly focusing on response measures to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.While he was busy dealing with the FDA in the U.S., rumors circulated in Korea that Kolon might have fabricated data to get Invossa approval or that the cells might not have been 293 cells but a third kind.The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is worried that its investigation into Kolon TissueGene might be difficult. Only Kolon TissueGene, based in Rockville in the U.S., has the research data for Invossa’s early development and the master cell bank. The ministry has requested Kolon Life Science to visit TissueGene’s headquarters. If TissueGene refuses to cooperate, there is no way the ministry could push through further.“On the surface, Kolon is acting as if it is cooperating with the ministry’s investigation, but there is no concrete outcome,” an official at the food and drug safety said, questioning if the company would submit additional data as requested by the ministry.As Kolon Life Science takes care of all the local matters, Kolon TissueGene is a step away from the Invossa issue.“Speculations over the second cell ingredient are snowballing. Why can’t TissueGene clarify all the questions,” asked an official in the biotech industry? “It will be important for the company to resume trials in the U.S. In Korea, however, it is a matter of Invossa’s survival in the market.” ",Why is TissueGene CEO silent about Invossa mislabeling?,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=5594
"A Korea-U.S. joint team has become the first in the world to find glucose-sensing neurons in the fruit fly's brain that directly function in the body's blood glucose level.The study, conducted by Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and New York University, is the first of its kind to reveal how blood glucose-sensing neurons in the brain are involved in glucose regulation by activating insulin-producing tissues and inhibiting glucagon-producing tissue activity.The team, led by Professors Suh Seong-bae from KAIST and Oh Yang-kyun from NYU, expect that the research will open up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes in the future.The prevalence of diabetes among Koreans is 14 percent, and the nation has recorded the fastest increase in diabetes patients in the world, as one in four Koreans is potential diabetes patients. The total number of diabetes patients also surpassed five million last year.Genetics and environmental factors exist, but most diabetic cases begin with decreased pancreatic insulin secretory function. Recent studies have also found that stress affects the diabetes process, as it makes it difficult for patients to control blood sugar. Researchers remain unclear, however, on which part of the brain function controls blood sugar levels.Suh's team had used fruit flies to study the presence of cells and receptors that detect glucose in the animal brain, as well as in the tongue and internal organs.Based on the study, the team predicted that there might be glucose-sensing neurons in the hypothalamus or posterior brain of the human brain as well. They then set out to examine how these cells sense glucose and give orders to different parts of the body.Through extensive screening of the entire brain neurons in the fruit fly, the team discovered a pair of neurons essential for determining the nutritional value of glucose. The researchers also found that these neurons activated in response to increased glucose levels in the body.They confirmed that these cells recognized glucose through a molecular system similar to human pancreatic cells. Such findings allowed the researchers to study glucose-sensing neurons to see which neurons and tissues they signal.Afterward, the team confirmed that the neurons form axons in the nerve tissue responsible for insulin production in fruit flies and in tissues that produce proteins that function as glucagon. The researchers also learned that a pair of glucose-sensing neurons could deliver nutritional information directly to tissues that produce hormones that are important for blood sugar control.To verify their theory, the team examined the physical and functional interactions between glucose-sensing neurons and two hormone-secreting tissues.The results demonstrated that when a pair of glucose-sensing neurons is activated, insulin-producing tissues are also activated, while glucagon-producing tissues are inhibited.In a situation where the team surpassed the glucose-sensing neurons, blood insulin levels decrease due to inhibition of insulin-producing tissues, and blood glucagon concentrations increase as the inhibition of glucagon-producing tissues disappears.By regulating the activity of only a pair of glucose-sensing neurons in the brain, it was possible to create fruit flies with diabetes artificially, according to its press release.Professor Suh said, ""The research allows us to change the paradigm of diagnosing and treating diabetes fundamentally. If the signals produced by the brain are found to play a fundamental role in regulating blood sugar in the body, it is possible to treat even treat obesity and metabolic diseases as well as diabetes.""The journal Nature published the results of the trial.",Korea-US researchers find brain neurons that control blood glucose levels,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6666
"Researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a sensor that can diagnose severe Alzheimer's disease with a drop of the patient's blood. Conventional diagnosis used positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment. However, both test methods are costly, raising the need for a diagnostic technology that is accurate and cheaper.The team, led by Professors Park Chan-bum and Steve Park at the university, developed a high-density diagnostic sensor that aligns carbon nanotubes using Langmuir-Blodgett film technology.Langmuir-Blodgett film technology is a technique for producing monolayers of nanoparticles floating on a solution in the desired arrangement by controlling surface pressure. At the same time, carbon nanotubes are cylindrical carbon materials with a diameter of about nanometers.Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia and is most common in older people. As of now, 10 percent of the world's population aged 65 or older suffers from this disease.""The sensitivity of the analyte measurement can be increased by reducing the resistance to a minimum when aligning the tubes rather than a randomizing the tubes,"" the team said.The researchers have confirmed that the developed sensor showed more than 100 times more sensitive than conventional carbon nanotube-based biosensors.The sensor can simultaneously measure four concentrations of Alzheimer's disease -- beta-amyloid 42, beta-amyloid 40, total-tau protein, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein.By using the developed sensor, the team compared the four biomarker concentrations by measuring the blood samples of Alzheimer's patients with healthy individuals. As a result, the team confirmed a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 88.6 percent.""The measuring method is simpler and cheaper to manufacture than conventional sensors,"" the team said.Professor Park said, ""This study included patients with severe illness who had confirmed Alzheimer's disease. The team requires cohort research support to test the diagnostic potential of patients with mild cognitive impairment, which is the precursor for dementia.""",KAIST develops method to diagnose Alzheimer's with single blood drop,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7201
"Bioengineering company Genexine said Monday that it has partnered with Binex, a CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) biopharmaceutical company, to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus.The two companies held a ceremony to launch a consortium on Friday, jointly with GenNBio, International Vaccine Institute, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).The consortium will develop a DNA vaccine using GX-19, Genexine’s drug candidate, to cope with COVID-19. The consortium plans to start the clinical trials from July.Genexine and Binex also signed a memorandum of understanding during the ceremony. The two companies synthesized a new antigen gene in February, and have begun to prepare to receive good manufacturing practice (GMP) certification.The two companies’ collaboration was based on their previous experiences in producing various DNA vaccines, including GX-188E, a cervical cancer vaccine.The companies will seek a procedure for rapid clinical approval as soon as they finish preparing clinical materials, and are planning to conduct clinical trials on healthy patients, too.Genexine and Binex plan to build a platform to develop vaccines against other new viruses quickly.“The construction of a platform to commercialize DNA vaccines will mean not just the success of developing a COVID-19 DNA vaccine, but have a great impact on the new vaccine paradigm,” officials from both companies said.","Genexine, Binex to develop COVID-19 vaccine",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7727
"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said it has developed an upgraded system to trace Covid-19 patients' movements without any risk of breaching individual privacy.The national research university worked on the upgraded Prevention System for Pandemic Disease Infection (PreSPI) based on a smartphone’s black box that can help individuals get the Covid-19 test, trace their contacts, and treat the disease.As the PreSPI used a black box of a smartphone to regularly collect and record signals coming from the global positioning system (GPS), wireless local area network (LAN), Bluetooth, barometer, and inertial sensors. It can minimize the risk of privacy infringement, KAIST said. The previous system, used for the disclosure of Covid-19 patients’ movement routes, came under fire because it extensively accessed to personal information such as credit card usage.Professor Han Dong-soo of the Computer Science Department of KAIST and his research team developed the latest PreSPI. The system collects signals from the GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and inertial sensors and automatically discards the information after two weeks.Data stored in an individual smartphone’s black box cannot be disclosed. As the system reveals the movements of a Covid-19 patient through signals, not texts, it can protect privacy.The PreSPI comes in three versions -- “Self-Examination System for Virus Exposure” for ordinary people and “Epidemiologic Investigation System” and “Isolated Person Management System” for the health authorities.The Self-Examination System for Virus Exposure helps the user check the possibility of virus exposure by comparing whether or not the movements of Covid-19 patients overlap with the movements recorded in the smartphone’s black box.The Epidemiologic Investigation System shows signals recorded on a Covid-19 patient’s smartphone on a map, which can help an epidemiological investigator identify the movements. This system uses the KAIST Locating System (KAILOS), an indoor/outdoor integrated location tracker developed by Han for over a decade, to identify the movements of a confirmed patient even inside a building.The Isolated Person Management System analyzes signals collected by a smartphone’s black box in real-time to check whether the patient is out of the isolated zone. It uses both GPS and wireless LAN signals to check whether the patient is out of a room, as well as out of a building.“More than 30 kinds of smartphones are being used for contact tracing. As different smartphones use different sensors, we’re testing the new system in various smartphones,” Han said. “As soon as we complete this work, we will launch the system.”KAIST President Shin Sung-chul said that the PreSPI could drastically save the energy and time of workers in the disease control area, including doctors and nurses who are under great pressure because of the resurge of Covid-19.

"The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Monday that a joint team of researchers have what causes the hyper-inflammatory response in severe Covid-19 patients.The hyper-inflammatory response, often called the “cytokine storm,” is a symptom, in which the cytokine, an immune substance, is secreted excessively and attacks healthy cells. Cytokine storm is known to cause severe Covid-19. Still, the hyper-inflammatory response's specific cause had been unknown, resulting in difficulties in treating Covid-19 patients.The rapidly spreading Covid-19 virus has infected more than 13 million people worldwide and claimed more than 500,000 lives.The joint research team, composed of Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIST) and Technology, Asan Medical Center, Severance Hospital, and Chungbuk National University Hospital, analyzed severe and mild Covid-19 patients' samples.The result showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which are inflammatory cytokines, were commonly observed in the immune cells of Covid-19 patients regardless of the degree of symptoms.According to a comparative analysis of severe and mild patients, the cytokine response called interferon was peculiarly strong in severe Covid-19 patients. Interferon is a type of cytokine secreted when its host cell is infected by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites, or with the presence of cancer cells.Generally, interferon type 1 produced by infected cells helps surrounding cells to exhibit antiviral defense against infection.The research team said that non-specific anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids could alleviate hyper-inflammatory response in patients with severe Covid-19. However, the study results could provide a new treatment that targets interferon.""We launched the study urgently to solve the medical problems of Covid-19 patients. Thanks to the support from Asan Medical Center, Severance Hospital, and Chungbuk National University Hospital, we could finish the study in three months,"" KAIST researcher Lee Jeong-seok said.KAIST will continue to study new immune mechanisms and personalized anti-inflammatory drugs to increase the survival rate of severe Covid-19 patients, he added.Their study, “Immunophenotyping of COVID-19 and Influenza Highlights the Role of Type 1 Interferons in Development of Severe COVID-19,” was published on the July 10 edition of the journal, Science Immunology.

"An interferon blocker might help treat patients with severe Covid-19 infection, a local health expert said.His claim is the opposite of the opinion of many researchers who are testing interferons as a treatment for Covid-19 in ongoing trials.Interferons are proteins made by cells in response to infection, suppressing viral infection, and proliferation.Shin Eui-cheol, a professor at the KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, said only severe Covid-19 patients showed strong interferon responses, at a YouTube show """" on Friday.He recently published his study in Science Immunology, suggesting that an interferon inhibitor could be one of the new treatment options for Covid-19 patients with serious symptoms.According to Shin, Covid-19 patients, regardless of the severity of symptoms, showed tumor necrosis factor (TNF), one of the cytokines signaling inflammation in the immune cells, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).In particular, a cytokine reaction called interferon was present only in severe Covid-19 patients, he said.People tend to say that a cytokine storm causes young Covid-19 patients' death only, not the aged, but this was not true, Shin said.Regardless of age, Covid-19 deaths result from excessive responses to inflammation, he noted.He thought TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 levels increased with the severity of symptoms in the past.However, his latest findings showed that their levels were already high, regardless of the disease's mildness and severity, Shin said.If interferons go up along with elevated levels of TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, they seem to trigger the severity. That is why he claimed that people might have to suppress interferons, he said.Shin cited the results of a paper on an experiment on rats injected with the SARS virus.“When the SARS virus was injected into the rats, they all died. It is advantageous if interferons come out quickly. Still, if they come late when symptoms get severe, they rather caused inflammation,” he said. “When interferons were blocked, rats that almost died recovered in the end.”In another experiment on rats infected with the MERS virus, using interferons immediately after the MERS infection worked effectively. However, after the rats got seriously sick, treating the rats with interferons led them to die, Shin said.“It may be the same drug, but it can cause completely different outcomes depending on when you use it,”Shin raised the possibility that researchers could develop a Covid-19 vaccine targeting a T-cell response in Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms.Citing papers from the U.S. and Europe, he said people who were never exposed to the Covid-19 virus did not have antibodies but T-cell responses.Shin said if researchers set a vaccine’s target as a T-cell response, the vaccine’s practical use will be different.While a neutralizing antibody-targeting vaccine can prevent Covid-19, a T-cell targeting vaccine will allow an infection but hinder its progress.",Will interferon blocker work on severe Covid-19 patients?,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=8791
"Genexine’s investigational Covid-19 vaccine and Celltrion’s treatment candidate showed antiviral effects in primates in pre-clinical trials.According to the pharmaceutical industry officials on Wednesday, Genexine’s DNA vaccine candidate GX-19 and Celltrion’s antibody treatment candidate CT-P59 showed defense and resistance efficacy against the Covid-19 virus in two primates modeled with Covid-19 infection at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB).In the primate tests, researchers administered one candidate vaccine and two candidate treatments to three monkeys, respectively, compared with the control group of three other monkeys.A monkey injected with the treatment candidate CT-P59 did not show any active Covid-19 virus 24 hours after the administration. The second monkey injected with the DNA vaccine GX-19 did not develop fever, as opposed to the control arm with fever. After 48 hours, the researchers did not detect any virus in the upper airway, the main route of infection. The KRIBB did not disclose the result of the third monkey tested with the second treatment candidate.“The primate infection models, verified by the KBIBB, showed lymphocyte reduction similar to the clinical infection pattern. But the monkey tested with GX-19 showed a slower reduction of lymphocytes than the control group and recovered quickly,” said Kim Sung-joo, CEO of GenNBio, a subsidiary of Genexine. Genexine’s vaccine candidate and Celltrion’s experimental treatment are undergoing human trials in local hospitals.The Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital in Seoul are conducting phase-1/2a studies on Genexine’s GX-919. On July 21, Genexine won the regulatory nod for the world’s first trial on a jet injector-type Covid-19 vaccine.Celltrion recently completed recruiting Covid-19 patients and began CT-P59 trials at the Chungnam National University Hospital in Daejeon, 140 kilometers south of Seoul.The two companies said their tests of vaccine and treatment candidates in primates proved efficacy and safety.“To prove a vaccine candidate’s efficacy, we induce viral infection after administering the vaccine. We call this ‘a challenge experiment.’ We can’t expose humans to the Covid-19 virus, so we do it to primates instead,” an official at Genexine said. “The latest primate models were designed similar to phase-3 trial conditions.”The latest primates modeled with Covid-19 infection were the world’s fourth, supported by the government and developed by the KRIBB.Participants in the consortium of industries, scholars, and researchers working on the primate infection model tests include Genexine, Binex, GenNBio, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).","Korean Covid-19 vaccine, treatment candidates effective in monkeys",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9002
"A Severance-KAIST research team has affirmed that deep learning using brain image big data can predict symptoms and severity of people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).ASD is one of the disorders caused by abnormal brain development. ASD patients show defects in social communications, limited range of interests, and repetitive behaviors. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that one in 54 people develop ASD, and the number is increasing every year. The prevalence of ASD is also about 2 percent in Korea.The diagnosis of the disorder is based on observing children’s behavior and counseling and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). However, an accurate diagnosis of ASD and prognosis is difficult due to wide individual differences.The joint research team developed a deep-learning model that can diagnose ASD and predict prognosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by using MRI big data of 84 ASD patients aged 3 to 11 collected at Severance Hospital and 1,000 autism cases piled up at an international consortium.Researchers built the model with a spatial transformer network and a three-dimensional convolutional neural network and trained with the MRI big data.The analysis of the study result showed that the subcortical structures, including the basal ganglia of the brain, are correlated with the severity of autism.“We have confirmed that there is a difference between the brain images of sub-symptoms and severity of autism,” Severance Hospital Professor Cheon Keun-Ah said. “The significance of this study is the personalized diagnosis and the prediction of prognosis for autistic patients with various clinical phenotypes and severity.”Professor Lee Sang-wan of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said, “We can now provide structurally associated candidates for diagnosing and studying autism in the medical field.

"Researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have found a biomarker that helps differentiate severe and mild Covid-19 patients quickly, the institute said Monday.Covid-19 has very different symptoms depending on the patients. To predict and differentiate a patient's severity, it is important to use biomarkers and select a targeted therapy that can treat them, the institute said.The team, led by Professor Lee Heung-kyu, discovered a factor that determines the severity of Covid-19 by revealing the association between neutrophils and glucocorticoids.The researchers analyzed the single-cell genetic information present in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of mild and severe patients with Covid-19 infection. They found that severe Covid-19 occurred due to the over-activation of neutrophils, the importance of which had been relatively unknown during viral infection.Particularly, they discovered that neutrophil influx increased due to chemokine, such as CXCL8, expressed in bone marrow-derived immune cells such as macrophages.""We found that the production of CXCL8 is regulated by the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in immune cells derived from bone marrow, which is consequently associated with the influx and activity of neutrophils,"" the institute said.Professor Lee also said, ""This study has led us to discover a biomarker that determines the severity of Covid-19 and to begin to develop a treatment that will ease its severity by making the most of glucocorticoid inhibitors.""The journal Frontiers in Immunology published the results of the study in its August issue.",KAIST discovers biomarker determining severity of Covid-19,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9166

MAIT cells are found in the blood, liver, lungs, and mucous membranes, and play a role in preventing infections such as microorganisms. Unlike normal T cells, it has both innate and acquired immune functions.Led by Professor Joo Dong-jin at the hospital, the research team planned the study to clarify MAIT cells' role in the liver. Professors Shin Eui-cheol and Park Su-hyung at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) also participated in the study.In liver transplantation, doctors excise the donor's liver and allow the perfusate to flow to preserve the liver.After separating sinusoidal mononuclear cells in the perfusate process, the research team used interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokine to react to MAIT cells. As a result, the expression of cytotoxic substances perforin and granzyme B increased according to these cytokines. Also, the expression ratio of MAIT cells and each substance increased statistically significantly.Notably, the team observed the proliferation of perforin and granzyme B induced by stimulation of interleukin-15 in MAIT cells in peripheral blood, too.""This shows that interleukin-15 plays an important role in MAIT cell activation,"" the team said. ""Also, MAIT cells stimulated by interleukin-15 were shown to induce cytotoxicity without the interaction of TCR/MR1.""Professor Joo said, ""Previous studies on the characteristics of MAIT cells have shown that interleukin-15 indirectly activates MAIT cells to produce perforin and granzyme B and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). However, this study showed that interleukin-15 directly activates MAIT cells and can exhibit cytotoxicity independently of TCR/MR-1.”The research team further conducted studies using acute hepatitis A patients' blood to confirm MAIT cells' role in actual liver disease.The team confirmed that in the patient's peripheral blood MAIT cells, the ratio of perforin and granzyme B and the expression of NKG2D, an important immunoreceptor, increased.""Additional study provided clues that MAIT cells would play an important role in increasing interleukin-15, especially in viral hepatitis,"" Joo said. ""This suggests that MAIT cells may be candidates for modulators to treat liver diseases such as acute hepatitis A.""The Journal of Hepatology published the results of the study.",'Liver MAIT cells induces cytotoxicity without stimulating TCR',http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9318
"A research institute-business enterprise joint team has developed a camera that recognizes cough sound in real-time and displays the coughing person's location as images.The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever and cough. Fever can be easily determined without having direct contact by using a thermal imaging camera. However, it has been challenging to find people who cough without contacting them.The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and SM Instrument have developed a deep learning-based model that recognizes cough sound to solve the problem. It also developed a camera that can track and record the cough sound, the position, and the number of coughs in real-time for visualizing those who cough with the same principle of the thermal imaging camera.The researchers applied supervised learning based on a convolutional neural network to develop the cough recognizing model. They also collected datasets from DEMAND, ETSI, TIMIT, and Audioset, an open voice dataset actively used for research by Google and YouTube, to train and evaluate the model.The background noise was mixed in the Audioset at a rate of 15 to 75 percent to enhance data, and the volume was adjusted to 0.25 to 1.0 times to adapt to various distances.The researchers used five acoustic features, such as spectrogram, and seven optimizers to train and measure the accuracy of the test data to check the performance, which resulted in 87.4 percent accuracy of the test. They then applied the trained model to an acoustic camera consisting of a microphone array and camera module for collecting sound.As a result, when the model recognized cough sound through beamforming for calculating the location of the sound source, contour lines and labels were displayed to indicate that the sound came from coughing.""The use of cough recognition cameras in public places and clustered facilities will help prevent and detect infectious diseases early amid continuous spread of Covid-19,"" said Professor Park Yong-hwa of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST, who led the research.The study was conducted with the support of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.",KAIST develops deep learning-based ‘cough-recognizing’ camera,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=8899
"A research team at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said it has developed Hi-COVIDNet, a big data and artificial intelligence platform that can predict the number of Covid-19 inflows from abroad.The technology developed by the research team, led by Professor Lee Jae-gil, applies AI to big data, such as the number of confirmed and fatalities, the frequency of searching for Covid-19-related keywords, the number of roaming customers entering Korea from overseas countries, and the number of daily flights to Korea from foreign countries, to predict the amount of virus inflows for the next two weeks.Researchers used the number of confirmed cases and deaths reported as a baseline when calculating the risk of Covid-19 in overseas countries. Since these numbers depend on the number of diagnostic tests, however, they also used Covid-19-related keyword search frequency as input data to calculate the country risks in real-time.Since the real-time number of entrants is confidential and not disclosed to the public, the team also derived such a number from the daily number of flights arriving in Korea and the number of roaming customers entering Korea.“We had to consider geographic relevance between countries as an important factor in predicting the number of confirmed imported cases,” the team said. “This is because the outbreak of Covid-19 in a particular country can more easily spread to neighboring countries, and distance among countries also affected their exchanges.”To solve this problem, the research team accurately predicted the number of confirmed cases of foreign inflows from each continent. After developing the platform, the team predicted the number of confirmed imported cases over the next two weeks through Hi-COVIDNet. As a result, it confirmed that this model has up to 35 percent higher accuracy than the existing time-series data-based predictive machine learning or deep learning-based models.“As the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 increases rapidly, the risk of overseas inflows spreading to the local communities always remains,” it said. “We expect the accurate prediction technology will be very useful for estimating the expansion of quarantine facilities and controlling immigration from high-risk nations.”The KAIST team plans to present its research during the ACM KDD 2020 conference on Aug. 24.",KAIST develops model predicting number of imported Covid-19 cases,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=8997

"Korean researchers have developed a gene analysis method called “RePlow,” which identifies micro-unit mutations that had been difficult to detect until now, the Korea Health Industry Development Institute said Monday.Various researchers have identified that genetic mutations in the human body are the root cause of various genetic diseases, including cancer, which makes precise examination and extraction of mutated genes essential.Recently, genetic testing has become relatively accurate through the development of next-generation sequencing technology. When the mutation is tiny, however, the test method either cannot detect or cause an error regarding the genetic mutation.The team, led by Professors Kim Sang-woo from Yonsei University College of Medicine and Lee Jeong-ho from KAIST Graduate School of Medicine, produced the reference material directly to determine the success of the detection and experimented with three different nucleotide sequences for comparison.As a result of the experiment, the team developed an analysis method to distinguish the mutation from the error by repeating the test at least two times.Through the new method named the researchers demonstrated that they could eliminate 99 percent of the errors in existing methods and successfully found a 0.5 percent level of mutations previously not seen in epileptic diseases.“Since the result of gene mutation test is directly related to the treatment of the patient, no error can be tolerated,” Professor Kim said. “We plan to continue improving the level of genetic analysis technology for the disease that needs more precise inspection such as brain nerve disease.”Nature Communications published the results of the study.

"A group of Korean researchers has developed the world’s first mouse model, which can alter body proteins to cause cancer, dementia and other degenerative diseases, government officials said Monday.The joint team of KAIST and Ajou University carried out the project as part of research tasks selected by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, and published its results on Nature Communications, an international academic journal, on Feb. 21, the ministry officials said.The new animal model can deliberately cause a variety of diseases such as cancer and dementia by abnormally acetylating -- the process of adding an acyl group to a compound -- the target protein. And researchers can make it happen in particular phases, such as the growth process within the mother after the fertilization, and in specific tissues or organs, including liver or lung.The researchers can use the new mouse model to identify the causes of these degenerative diseases and develop customized drugs to treat cancers and traumatic brain injuries. The approximately 20,000 kinds of proteins produced in our body regulate cell signaling and growth through post-translational modification such as acetylation, phosphorylation, and scarification after biosynthesis. Protein modification causes damage to cellular signaling and metabolism, leading to cancer and dementia and other serious diseases.The National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation under the wing of the ministry has developed 34 kinds of animal models with a particular illness, including obesity, diabetes, tumors and immunodeficiency, and plans to develop 18 more by 2018 and use them for developing new drugs and assessing medical products, the officials said.

"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has global pharmaceutical companies and startups in a race to develop new products and services in all sectors. The field of healthcare is no exception with the U.S. leading the way in AI startups. Many startups partner with bigger companies or become part of the latter.The National Information Society Agency released a report Tuesday on promising AI startups in Korea, including six in the field of healthcare -- Neofect, Vuno, Tomocube, Lunit, Standigm, and Bitfinder. The following are brief introductions of them.Neofect is an AI startup that provides rehabilitating training products and services “available anytime and anywhere.” As a rehabilitation hardware and software manufacturing company, they secured around 11.8 billion won ($10.34 million) of investments from several venture capitalists from 2012 to 2016. It won the ninth digital innovation awards in 2014, and the CES Innovation Awards this year.Its “Rapael Smart Rehab Solution” – composed of Rapael Smart Glove, Smart Kids, and Smart Board – is a customized rehabilitation solution for patients with neurological and musculoskeletal injuries. Rapael uses portable, lightweight equipment to use at home while providing rehab training contents in the form of games, called “gamification,” adding fun to the therapy experience.The company is expanding fast, having established its San Francisco branch in 2015 and German office in 2016. Their products are used in more than 10 domestic hospitals, having gained U.S. FDA approval in 2014. They have partnered with Samsung Medical Center, Severance Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to perform clinical trials as well as collaborating with Dankook University, National Rehabilitation Center, Seoul National University, and KAIST to develop its products. Vuno uses deep learning to develop software to deliver assessments of patient data and put “the world’s medical data to work.” VunoMed, a medical data analysis platform that provides data analysis of medical videos, ECG/Brain wave data, and EMR data, boasts 91 percent accuracy in diagnosing lung cancer, compared with a 60 percent match probability when two different doctors diagnose using the same CT scan.VunoNet is its proprietary deep learning engine that processes medical data such as X-ray, CT, and MRI data to build models for how diseases develop in the body. The company took the fifth place in the national competition called ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge.

"The “Global Bio Conference 2017 (GBC 2017)” kicked off its annual conference for a three-day run at Seoul Intercontinental Seoul COEX Hotel in southern Seoul Wednesday.The international conference, hosted by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (Minister Sohn Mun-gi) invited a host of domestic and foreign experts to discuss the role of the biopharmaceutical industry in leading the fourth industrial revolution.The conference opened with a commemorating video message from President Moon Jae-in, who noted that biopharmaceutical innovation such as cell fusion gene therapy, cellular gene therapy, and 3D bio-printing have garnered international attention and has the potential for becoming the next growth engine.“Korea is planning to expand research and development investments and tax breaks significantly and actively nurture professional manpower,” Moon said. “In this regard, we are looking forward to creating a fair competition base for successful bio ventures and small- and medium-sized enterprises.”Moon noted that the industry could grow only when “profitability and public value is kept evenly balanced.” He expressed his hopes that “the conference would strengthen international cooperation and serve as an opportunity to promote human health.”The ministry said the meeting would help Korean biopharmaceuticals become the center of the world’s biopharmaceutical industry and to share knowledge and experience with domestic and foreign experts on global issues. The ministry said it aims to become the “center of communication to strengthen safety management through cooperation between institutes.”The international conference will offer special lectures by Korean and foreign experts, forums for biopharmaceutical sectors such as vaccines, cell, and gene therapy, and a special event for exporting domestic development products.Among the lecturers are Professor Lee Min-hwa of Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST), Michael Goettler, Pfizer’s global president on rare diseases, McKinsey’s Axel Baur, IBM’s Michael Weiner, and UC Berkeley Professor Kim Sung-hou.The lectures will touch on a variety of topics regarding the progress of the biopharmaceutical industry in the fourth industrial revolution and the science of biopharmaceutical regulations such as artificial intelligence, induced pluripotent stem cells, and 3D printing. In one of such lectures, a multinational drugmaking company executive said the global pharmaceutical industry is on the verge of using medicine not to treat patients but to cure them.This paradigm shift “from treatment to cure” will take place over the next couple of decades, said Michael Goettler, head of the rare diseases division at Pfizer. Goettler pointed out that current science in healthcare is not treating the actual disease but its symptoms. For example, aspirin treats inflammation, not the cause of inflammation.Noting that the fourth industrial revolution will change the overall goal of developing drugs, Goettler said, “Biologics changes the course of the disease by manipulating human genes to trick nature into creating the cure.”In this regard, the expert pointed to gene therapy as the most likely sector to produce the cure, using as evidence the significant number of publications and human clinical trials being conducted in the field in contrast to other areas such as gene editing and RNAi.Even now, gene therapy can address genetic diseases in the eye, Goettler pointed out, which is feasible since the eye is small and therefore accessible for small, direct injections. Therefore, rare monogenic diseases will be the first to have cures within the next five years, followed by targetable rare diseases such as hemophilia and sickle cell disease, difficult rare and targetable non-rare diseases, and finally ending with moderately difficult non-rare diseases.“Towards the end, we will find the cause for all. We will find a cure that will trick the brain to produce its dopamine, and trick the body into creating its own medicine,” Goettler added.Although the industry is a highly competitive space, collaboration is increasing at an equal pace, he added. Clusters of pharmaceutical companies and research institutions are quickly evolving to work together to bring treatments to patients. However, Goettler pointed out the question of the payment system. “How are we going to pay for these cures? Our health system is not geared towards creating cures but paying for vials and treatments.”In this regard, Korea excels as a single payer system, Goettler noted. “This is not good news for other countries that have a multi-payer system such as the U.S., where the system is not geared towards providing united healthcare for the entire nation,” he said.",‘Global Bio Conference 2017’ opens for 3-day run at COEX,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=782
"A team led by Professor Kim Il-doo of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST) has developed a sensor that can diagnose diseases through breathing, using animal protein as a catalyst, the institute said Tuesday.The technology enables early monitoring of diseases through pattern recognition of biomarker gases related to various diseases involved in human exhalation that is more accurate and has a high sensitivity, KAIST said. Not only a variety of single metal particles but also any combination of various particles can be synthesized to a size of 2 nanometers, it added.The research paper in which Drs. Kim Sang-joon and Choi Sun-jintook part as first authors appeared in the July issue of the ""Accounts of Chemical Research"" in the international journals of the American Chemical Society as well as in “Advanced Materials” Wiley online library, a German magazine.Breathing fingerprint sensor technology is a key future technology to detect various illnesses with only breath exhalation without blood smear or imaging. It is possible to judge the health abnormality by checking the concentration change of the specific gases in the breath.Exhalation gas components include hydrogen, acetone, toluene, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen monoxide in addition to moisture. These gases are biomarker gases emitted at high concentrations in patients with certain diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, Type 1 diabetes, and bad breath.Diagnosis of the disease is easier because the analysis of the exhalation gas collection “Tedlar” bag is similar to a breathalyzer at a faster rate, and when injected into a small sensor device it can diagnose the disease. Also, detection can be done at the time of disease metabolism, enabling early diagnosis.However, technological advances are needed to accurately analyze gases in the respiratory stream, which occur at very mild levels, from one-billionth (ppb) to one millionth (ppm). Hundreds of obstructive gases, especially moisture, remain a weak point for resistance-based sensors that selectively analyze certain disease-related biomarker gases.Conventional gas sensors attempted to improve the sensing characteristics by combining specific catalysts such as platinum and palladium, but there was a limitation in that the natural surface gas sensing characteristics was not high at the ppb concentration. To overcome the limitations of existing sensors, the research team succeeded in synthesizing various catalyst particles precipitated in a hollow protein shell using Nano-sized proteins present in animal tissues as a sacrificial layer.The Nano-sized proteins utilized in this study have the great advantage that various kinds of heterogeneous catalysts can implement by combining the elemental materials present in the periodic table.In particular, it is a remarkable method regarding the synthesis of a catalyst having a novel composition since the composition ratio between two elements can be easily controlled and an intermetallic compound can be produced.For example, when platinum is the reference catalyst, it can be extended to various heterogeneous catalysts such as platinum palladium (PtPd), platinum nickel (PtNi), platinum ruthenium (PdRu), and platinum yttrium (PtY3).The research team developed a sensing material that binds the developed heterogeneous catalyst particles to metal oxide nanofibers with a wide specific surface area and porous structure, selectively reacting only to particular bio induced gases, KAIST said. The nanofiber sensors with heterogeneous catalysts were found to have improved detection characteristics by about three to four times that of platinum or palladium catalysts, which are known to have the highest catalytic activity, it added.Especially, acetone or hydrogen sulfide gas showed the highest sensitivity characteristic that the sensitivity changed to 100 times at one ppm.The team also developed a disease diagnosis platform that recognizes human fingerprints and recognizes individual breathing patterns by using a sophisticated sensor array system with various kinds of sensing materials, so that the public can quickly identify the health abnormality.Sixteen types of sensors with different selectivity have been successfully arrayed and since the expiratory concentration changes differently according to the health state of the patient, and the healthcare device.""By using two-nanometer heterogeneous catalysts that have never been used in sensors, we can implement a sensor material library that responds to disease-related biomarker gases with high sensitivity and high selectivity,” Professor Kim said. ""We will be able to develop sensors that can diagnose numerous diseases by securing various catalyst groups in the future.”He added that sensors that diagnose diseases by breathing would help increase the cost of medical expenses by starting self-diagnosis devices that anyone can easily diagnose themselves.",KAIST team develops breath sensor diagnosing diseases,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=909

"Hanall Biopharma and Daewoong Pharmaceutical said they filed an investigational new drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday to conduct a phase 2 clinical trial for its dry eye treatment.The dry eye treatment, HL036, is being developed to treat patients who lack tear production or experience excessive tear evaporation, resulting in ocular surface damage.The number of patients with dry eye symptom has been increasing in an aging society, excessive use of computers, and environmental changes such as more use of air conditioning and heating appliances.The market for anti-dryness treatment has been estimated to be around 3 trillion won ($2.66 billion) worldwide.The companies expect HL036, an anti-TNF antibody, to have a greater effect on treating dry eye syndrome because it has exhibited more excellent tissue distribution, stability and activity compared to conventional antibodies.Hanall became Daewoong’s subsidiary in August, 2015. The two companies are jointly managing R&D projects for the third consecutive year and have seen notable synergy, Daewoong said.Daewoong and Hanall have also seen synergy on the immunotherapy front, developing new cancer therapies such as HL161, HL186, and HL187, the companies said.HL161 is a next-generation, first-in-class antibody drug that treats autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, and optic neuritis, caused by autoantibodies that attack itself, Hanall said. The company expects the drug to dramatically improve drug efficacy and safety and lower costs, compared to existing treatments.Hanall will submit the phase one clinical trial IND application in the third quarter of this year and begin clinical trials in Australia in the fourth quarter.Hanall has also set spun off synthetic drug research in 2016 to establish Immunomet in the U.S. to strengthen immunotherapy research, the company said.The two companies have also invested around 6 billion won in October to create an in-house venture-type research organization comprised of KAIST and Yonsei University professors to develop new immunotherapies.The study aims to develop a drug for cancer patients that have not responded to first-generation immunotherapies such as Yervoy, Opdivo, Keytruda, and Tecentriq.The two have aimed to achieve synergy on the sales and marketing front and will begin implementing its cross-selling strategy from the third quarter of this year, hoping to see a 20 percent increase in sales from the expected synergy.They will also pursue cost-effective strategies to achieve synergy regarding production, Hanall said.“The synergy plans that have been prepared and carried out during the third year of joint management are leading to success in each division,” said Hanol BioPharma CEO Park Seung-guk. “In particular, we were able to strengthen our global capabilities by concentrating research funding on biologics such as antibody drugs and R&D.""","Hanall, Daewoong develop new drug for dry eye treatment",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1204
"The development of Artificial Intelligence is expected to impact society across diverse fields, and the medical field is no exception.A report titled ‘Korea’s Future Jobs in 10 Years’ published by Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology(KAIST), The Committee of Future Planning of the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, and Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning suggests the necessity for reorganizing medical licenses to anticipate changes caused by technological progression.As a product of the technological revolution, AI is expected to create new opportunities for income for a broader range of professionals.Doctors, in particular, are said to be one of those professions.Human-computer cooperation implies the ability to synthesize information provided by technology and the analytical opinions formed by people. The committee states that ‘Human-Computer Union is vital in areas where statistical decision-making is more dangerous. Doctors and businessmen work in those areas.”Because medical professionals deal with saving human lives, they need access to tools that push them towards accuracy and rationality in the decision-making process.AI will help medical professionals reach the best solution by using algorithms and providing analytical data. However, even with the emergence of advanced AI systems such as Watsons, humans still make the final decision.The committee states that medical professionals will be required to demonstrate 3 core competencies in order to achieve synergy with AI: systematic analysis, decision-making abilities and ICT understanding.The committee predicts that “new technology will spur the medical industry and create new job roles within the field,” adding that “nurses will be able to perform a greater range of medical services by receiving support from AI software, and doctors will be able to make decisions based on algorithms and data analysis in areas where it was virtually impossible. It may even lead to the creation of a new profession that lies between job title of doctor and nurse.”In anticipation of the future human-computer union, the committee emphasized the need to “prioritize systematic reorganization in order for the progression of technology to stimulate the creation of new, high-quality jobs.”",AI to Create New Jobs in Medical Industry,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=64

Sixty 60 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, who are undergoing hepatic artery chemoembolization, participated in it at six clinical institutes, including Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) .Hwang said the NK cell became successful thanks to cooperation between multiple institutes. The cooperation was extensive starting with SNUH developing the elemental technology based on medical demand. Mogam Institute  acted as a bridge between the industry and academia and worked on the practical application of basic technology. Later, it conducted the validation, immunoassay, and mechanism study using animal models with KAIST  and Hanyang University .Green Cross , the parent company of Green Cross Cell, also performed phase 1 clinical trials and transferred process development and gave technical cooperation.“Since we secured the patents for our technology, we have been collaborating with a variety of institutes to achieve full potential,” Hwang said. “The cooperation has led to a substantial upgrade in our technology.”The subsequent session led by Jang Ki-ho, a board member of Angook Pharmaceuticals , stressed the need to approach from a business perspective and decide a position in the market from the early stage of the new drug development.Angook has recently been developing AG-B1512, a growth hormone deficiency medication, which has entered phase 1 clinical trials with the government’s support. The drug showed promising results in animal test showing 20 to 40 times longer half-life compared to first-generation growth hormone (IGF-1).The company sought to use CROs and CMOs in the early stages of development, avoiding new drugs with a high mechanism of action and reviewing projects with low risk.“Pharmaceuticals should set their targets separately for domestic and global markets,” Jang said. “If the company is aiming for the global market it should review its marketability in emerging markets and advanced nations.”In targeting specific diseases, the company should consider clinical difficulty and the competition, he added.“New drug development has to approach with a business mindset to obtain higher value than competitors’ in R & D process,” Jang said.The remainder of the session discussed in detail biotech issues such as exosome, cell therapy, and microbiome.KPBMA  Chairman Won Hee-mok  presented the organization's goal, expressing his intention to continue such forums.“Although information sharing is important, it is hard for pharmaceutical companies and bio-ventures to get together and share information,” Won said. “Even if we cannot establish a venue for information sharing today, we must continue to accumulate our achievements and create a network, a place to coexist and cooperate.”","Green Cross Cell, Ahngook fete innovation at ‘KPBMA Bio Open Plaza’",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1463
"The Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) said they opened a control tower for bio-enterprises and startups dubbed the “Seoul BioHub” in Dongdaemun, northeastern Seoul, on Monday.Mayor Park Won-soon led the opening ceremony with around 200 participants, including officials from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and universities such as Korea University and KAIST.The hub is a cluster of biotechnology research institutes, private companies, and hospitals that will act as a professional bio-startup platform that includes everything from research support to local openings and global cooperation, the institute said.It will open four sectors – the Industry Support Sector, Research and Experimentation Sector, Regional Operation Sector, and Global Cooperation Sector – in successive order until 2023.By 2023, the BioHub will have a total of 500 bio-startup residential spaces for both public and private enterprises. It will also invest a total of 15 billion won ($1.3 million) to supply 99 kinds of research equipment, including microscopes, cell incubators, and centrifuges while using 40 billion won to create a support system that helps develop startups.One feature of the BioHub allows start-ups, global companies, and partner companies to move in and develop their businesses, helping them bypass the so-called Death Valley phase in which startups plateau after three to five years.Companies will be able to compete in a bio startup challenge where a total of 10 teams will have an opportunity to move into the Seoul BioHub. The operators will give 150 million won and all-in-one consulting services to the top five teams, it said.The BioHub will also establish partnerships with regional bio-clusters such as those in Osong, Daegu, and Wonju, and operate educational programs for starting entrepreneurs as well as global experts, the agency said.“The Seoul BioHub is an anchor facility that supports the entire cycle for both startups looking to grow and enterprises seeking advances into the global market,” said an official from the Seoul Metropolitan Government. “We will work closely with the central government and regional clusters to spread the development for the bio-industry as a key growth driver.”","Seoul, KHIDI opens ‘BioHub’ as control tower for bio-growth",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1746
"Korea’s biopharmaceutical industry is increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to develop new drugs, using state-of-the-art technology to shorten development and production costs.AI can identify patterns people miss by cross-examining millions of compounds simultaneously, eliminating the guesswork in drug development that leads to substantial time and financial investment.The U.S. FDA estimates that drug development takes around 10 years and costs an average of $2.6 billion (about 2.8 trillion won).Global pharmaceuticals such as Pfizer, Merck, GSK, and Sanofi are teaming up with AI technology powerhouses and startups such as IBM, Xsienia, AtomWise, and Birnbacherland to develop new drugs faster.Some domestic pharmaceuticals are also ramping up efforts to utilize AI. Big-name Korean pharma such as Green Cross, Daewoong, and Dong-A ST are among many that use the technology to cut development time and efforts.The companies are also pushing for AI-based new drug development on an industry level. The Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-pharma Manufacturers’ Association (KPBMA), composed of 183 pharmaceutical companies, joined forces with Korea Conformity Laboratories (KCL) this month to share information related to AI-based new drug candidates.Korean start-ups are also making waves in AI-based new drug development. Among Korean startup companies, Standigm, PharosIBT, and Syntekabio are taking the lead.Founded by three Ph.D.s from Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Standigm is an AI-based drug discovery company that develops crystal biomolecules and immunotherapies.The company uses AI to find patterns in biomedical data to save time and cost in drug development, eliminating the uncertainty in the drug discovery process and focusing on candidates that are likely to succeed, it said.""Reducing the time and cost of new drug development by 30 percent will increase profits by 120 percent,” CEO Kim Jin-han told local media. ""Korean pharmaceuticals had difficulty competing with global pharma due to the lack of capital but artificial intelligence can give Korean companies an upper hand.”The company has multiple projects that include predicting synergetic drug combinations, learning drug-perturbed data, building and learning biological knowledge, drug target prediction and EMR data representation.Standigm has joined hands with CrystalGenomics, universities such as Ajou University and KAIST and research institutions, including Korea Institute of Science of Technology, for drug discovery.The company also launched two customer-friendly services called Expander and Hunter, which allow users to quickly identify a novel clinical use for their existing drugs and even potential drug candidates for specific diseases with low cost and effort, it said.Pharos iBT, a drug discovery and development biotech company specializing in collecting and analyzing big data, focuses on developing orphan drugs, or drugs for rare diseases.The company is developing treatments for colorectal cancer and leukemia by using artificial intelligence to analyze more than a million compounds and two million drug target proteins each day.Its AI technology helps predict various properties of a compound and introduce a low-cost and efficient new drug development system, it said. The company is currently in partnership with Asan Medical Center and Chodang Pharmaceutical to develop colon cancer drugs, as well as with the Korea Institute of Science and Technology to develop drugs for acute myeloid leukemia.Pursuing an open innovation platform, Pharos iBT uses external CRO and out-licensing business model with global pharmaceuticals, it said.Founded in 2009, Syntekabio is a bioinformatics venture focusing on genome integration that uses AI deep learning technology.The company utilizes high-performance computing hardware systems to speed up drug-target protein interactions 10-fold while increasing the accuracy of predictions. The technology applies 20 million drug candidates to 800 abstract cell lines each day to save time and costs that arise from trial-and-error, it said.The company utilizes its drug virtual screening system to discover new compounds for several diseases and its in-silico service to support drug candidate development, it said.Syntekabio signed an agreement with CJ Healthcare Wednesday to co-develop a new immunotherapy using AI. Syntekabio will handle the drug development process, including virtual discovery and lead compounds discovery, and CJ Healthcare will be responsible for clinical trials and commercialization, the company said.The two companies expect to reduce the cost and shorten the development period by 40 percent using AI technology, it added.",3 Korean startups using AI to develop new drugs,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2137
"Researchers at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) have developed for the first time a test that can differentiate benign and malignant ovarian tumors through a simple blood test, the hospital said Monday.Ovarian cancer is one of the three major cancers contracted by women along with breast and cervical cancer. The tumor is easily treatable in earlier stages, but as it does not portray any specific symptoms, about 80 percent of patients find out they have the illness during the final stages of cancer -- end of phase three and later.The SNUBH team led by Professor Kim Yong-bum of the department of gynecology developed a new type of non-invasive biopsy test that can accurately determine cancers cells within the blood by examining only five millimeters of the patient's blood.Traditionally, an invasive biopsy was the only method that could accurately differentiate benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Although blood tests and image diagnosis were available, it was only used as a reference as they lacked accuracy.The team examined 87 patients who were awaiting surgery, using its new detector system developed by KAIST Blood Cancer Cell Research Group from 2015 to 2016 and compared the test results with those obtained by the existing test methods to prove its efficacy.As a result, the new method yielded a sensitivity of 100 percent and a specificity of 55.8 percent. The result was superior compared to the conventional blood diagnosis, ultrasound differential diagnosis, and image diagnosis. Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify those patients with the disease, while specificity refers to the ability of the test to identify those patients without the disease correctly.“The team applied new immunostaining and detection technology to increase the reliability of cancer cell detection,” Professor Kim said. “The method is the world's first test that revealed that blood cancer cells could be used to differentiate benign and malignant ovarian tumors.”The team expects that the study results will improve the possibility of early diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the future and ultimately contribute to improving the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients, Kim added.The results of the study were published in Oncotarget, an oncology journal.",SNUBH diagnoses ovarian cancer with blood test,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2087
"The Fourth Industrial Revolution, the digital revolution with a fusion of technologies, will stimulate hospitals to change their healthcare systems to patient-centric ones, an expert said Wednesday.Jeong Jae-seung, a professor of bio and brain engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), made the point during his lecture titled “What physicians should do to prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”“In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be a system that monitors what people want, makes data based on experience, and provides customized service based on such information,” Jeong said. He noted that people might think such world will put too much focus on technologies, but in fact, it will concentrate more on humans.Jeong’s lecture was part of an academic conference at Myongji Hospital in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province. The Korean Doctors’ Weekly, Korea BiomedicalReview’s sister paper, and Samjong KPMG co-hosted the conference, under the title of “Hospital Innovation and Patient Experience Conference 2018 (HiPex 2018).”“People might think hospital jobs could vanish due to advanced systems in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but that is not true,” Jeong said. “If the systems change to a customer- and patient-centered ones, medical workers will be able to use these data to offer better healthcare.”Jeong went on to say that in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, occupations will change rather than disappear.“The life spans of the technologies have become shortened, and the biological life span of human life is getting longer. We’re heading towards an era where people cannot live life only with what they learned in college,” the professor said.Jeong advised people turn away from worrying that if they could continue working until retirement without learning anything new but apply new systems and use them. “It is important to get rid of fear,” he said.Jeong took an example of Harvard Medical School to explain how quickly the school adapted its curriculum to meet the needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. “The school teaches patient experience from the undergraduate stage. It has become less important to put medical knowledge elaborately into the heads. Instead, it has become more significant to learn how to treat patients,” he said.Jeong said Harvard’s medical curriculum includes engineering education and the handling of equipment, adding that the entire U.S. university education was changing.“Patient experience is important. We have to think hard in advance how to make our healthcare systems to help patients receive better service at hospitals and be discharged,” he emphasized.",‘4th Industrial Revolution to change hospital care to patient-centered’,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=3540
"Researchers from the National Cancer Center and Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) have developed a web-based cancer mutation analysis system dubbed the Mutalisk, the NCC said Thursday.The MUTation AnaLyIS toolKit (Mutalisk) is a system that reveals the characteristics of the mutations of a cancer patient’s somatic cells while also clarifying the cause and progression of cancer.Developed by a team led by NCC’s Hong Dong-wan, chief of Clinical Genomic Analysis Branch, and KAIST Professor Ju Young-seok, Mutalisk is the world's first web-based analysis tool that provides accurate and rapid correlation of omics information for cancer cell mutations.Cancer-inducing somatic mutations are attributable to a variety of causes, including smoking cigarettes and ultraviolet light. Somatic mutations can also occur during the DNA replication process or due to damaged reactions. The accumulation of these mutations fuels cancer growth.Mutations, however, have a “mutational signature” that varies according to the cause. Lung cancer patients, for example, have different cancer cell mutation characteristics depending on their smoking status. For skin cancer, mutation characteristics differ depending on whether it was caused by ultraviolet ray-induced DNA damage or by aging.Identifying mutation characteristics of the somatic cells of cancer cells provides clues about pathogenesis. It can also be used to establish a customized treatment strategy. Despite the need to know the exact nature of mutations for cancer care, however, readily usable systems have been hard to find.Mutalisks - a web-based analysis system - provides an integrated analysis of genomes, transcripts, and progeny genomes based on mutation characteristics of cancer cells’ somatic cells that are derived from next-generation sequencing analysis.The system provides data on various genetic information that occurs as a gene mutation progresses into cancer -- such as the mutation site of a super mutation, guanine-cytosine ratio, transcription strand, the timing of mutation, and histone change -- and the relationship between them.“This analysis system will make it easier to reveal the diversity of mutations that cause the development and progression of cancer cells in various carcinomas, thus contributing to the systematic construction of precision medical care,” said Hong Dong-wan who led the study.The findings were published online in the May 22 edition of Nucleic Acids Research, international journal biotechnology.","NCC, KAIST develops cancer mutation analysis system",http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=3769
"Amid forecasts that the obesity therapy market will rapidly grow, local researchers have increasingly registered patents related to the treatment of obesity. The Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) said it has granted more than six obesity-targeting patents in August.Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) registered the patent on “Compositions for Preventing or Treating Metabolic Diseases.” The inventors are Professor Kim Ha-il and two other KAIST researchers.  According to the researchers, the patent offers compositions to prevent or treat metabolic diseases that include TPH 1 (Tryptophan hydroxylase 1), the HTR2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor), or the HTR 3 (5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor) inhibitor. They hope that the patent will help prevent obesity-caused adult diseases. “In modern society, the prevalence of diseases, including type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arteriosclerosis, are increasing, the researchers said. “Heart disease and stroke are rapidly rising, and they have become the second and third leading causes of death in Korea.” Caregen, an R&D-based firm specializing in skin care and peptide, also registered a patent called “Peptide Having Anti-Diabetic and Anti-Obesity Effects and Its Use.” The company said the invented peptide suppresses fat accumulation and decompose already-accumulated fat. The invention also reduces blood sugar levels effectively, which could show efficacy in diabetes, according to the company. The latest peptide could be much safer than conventional obesity treatments, the company said. “Obesity treatments can be divided into two types of drugs – one applies to the central nervous system to affect appetite and the other acts on the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit absorption,” Caregen said in the patent description. “Some existing drugs were banned because of side effects, and others could not be used for patients with heart failure and kidney disease for concerns of decreased blood pressure or lactic acidosis.” It went on to say, “The invented peptide shows an excellent effect for diabetes and obesity-associated diabetes. High-fat diet causes fat accumulation in liver and muscles, which suppresses insulin signals. This causes insulin resistance, leading to diabetes. This peptide can be used to prevent or treat diabetes or obesity-related diabetes.” Other obesity-related patents registered this month include injection compositions for local fat decomposition, anti-obesity composition with red bean skin extract as the active ingredient, and anti-appetite suppression balloon with a marker that can be checked by medical imaging equipment.

"Korean researchers have for the first time in the world identified the onset area of carcinogenesis in glioblastoma, a devastating and incurable brain cancer, which is expected to change the paradigm of cancer treatment.The study, which overturns stereotypes about existing research and treatment, is a new turning point in therapy due to the revelation of the causation origin of glioblastoma. Researchers found that human glioblastomas arise from subventricular zone cells where the cancer is not present. The findings are published in the latest issue of the world's most prominent journal Nature.The Yonsei University Severance Hospital team, led by Professor Kang Seok-gu from the Department of Neurology, and the KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering team directed by Professor Lee Jeong-ho conducted the study.Glioblastoma is the most common brain tumor that can cause headaches due to elevated intracranial pressure, dysfunction due to brain tissue destruction such as cranial nerve paralysis, speech disorder, personality change, mental dysfunction, and seizures due to abnormal brain stimulation.Although surgical treatment is the most important treatment for glioblastoma, and postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the standard treatment, the prognosis is poor. Precision cancer treatment approaches using targeted anticancer agents have also shown a poor response.In the United States and Europe, studies on glioblastoma and clinical trials have been underway, but most focused only on the cancer tissue itself.The research team took a different approach. Unlike conventional studies on a cancer tissue, researchers studied three different types of tissue - tumor tissues, healthy tissues and perineural tissues obtained during broad-spectrum resection – to investigate the mechanism of glioblastoma.The research teams analyzed 30 cases of brain tumors that were operated on from 2013 to 2017. Researchers comprehensively combined and examined tumor tissues, healthy tissues, and perineural tissues.As a result, tumor-induced mutant cells were found at low frequencies in the subventricular zone that did not have cancer cells. In fact, in about 56 percent of glioblastoma patients' tumors, researchers found the observed tumor-induced mutations were found in low frequency in the subventricular region where the tumor was absent. In particular, mutations were concentrated in the astrocytic ribbon region in the subventricular zone.Researchers also confirmed through single-cell sequencing that tumor-induced mutant cells in the subventricular region migrate to other parts of the brain over time. Single cell sequencing is a state-of-the-art gene analyzing method capable of analyzing even small amounts of cells by providing spatial information on cell location.Animal studies to verify the glioblastoma generation mechanism also produced the same results. According to the team, tumor-induced mutant cells such as P53, PTEN, and EGFR were generated in the subventricular region in the genetically modified animal model and migrated to other parts of the brain. Glioblastomas then developed over time.The results of this study are expected to change the paradigm of cancer treatment and lead to clues for therapy not only glioblastoma but also other cancers.""The study is a breakthrough regarding finding the development of cancer in which human glioblastomas begin to develop in the subventricular zone where normal neural stem cells are present, not where cancer originated,"" Professor Kang said. “We need to change the direction of cancer research from those that focus on cancer tissues to focus on tissues where cancer originates to solve the mystery of cancer treatment and open a new paradigm.""The team is working on an innovative treatment to prevent the process of tumor-induced mutations in the subventricular zone that evolves into glioblastomas.The research was supported by the Korea Research Foundation, the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, the Suh Kyungbae Foundation, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare.",Severance becomes world’s 1st to identify carcinogenesis mechanism in glioblastoma,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=3868
"KAIST researchers have successfully developed a snake-like, flexible endoscopic surgical robot and used it to conduct surgery on a live pig by removing its gallbladder, the university said Thursday.The team led by Professor Kwon Dong-soo, who is also director of the Center for Future Medical Robotics at KAIST, developed the flexible endoscopic surgical robot called the K-FLEX.The K-FLEX can be inserted into the body through the mouth, anus, and urethra and freely observe the body’s insides.Conventional commercialized surgical robots are problematic in that they have “straight” surgical tools and require having to cut three to four holes in the abdomen.The K-FLEX doesn’t require external incisions, thereby reducing the risk of bleeding, bacterial infection, and other complications. KAIST stressed that all parts and software of the K-FLEX was developed with domestic technology.Despite these advantages, the skill required to complete surgery is high while the robot must be able to move flexibly and exert a large force to enter the curved parts of the human body, making it subject to more spatial constraints than conventional surgical robots.To solve these problems, the research team developed a robust miniaturized joint technology. Dr. Hwang Min-ho, a principal researcher, more than doubled the strength of the tiny robot arm while reducing its size by half, according to KAIST.In the case of an abnormality, the miniature finger-like robot arm comes out to perform a surgical operation.Researchers at KAIST used the surgical robot to complete the preclinical trial on a pig in July. In the experiment, researchers removed the gallbladder by inserting K-FLEX into the abdominal cavity. The surgical robot was inserted through the incision made on the surface of the pig’s stomach and flexed in various directions and angles to approach the liver and gallbladder where the lesion was located.Researchers then passed a small 3.7 mm surgical instrument to remove the gallbladder.All procedures were monitored through a camera installed in the front of the endoscope and executed through a remote control device.""This experiment is significant in that it is the first time in Korea where a flexible endoscopic surgical robot was moved through the abdominal cavity of a living animal to approach the lesion - confirming the possibility of clinical application,"" Professor Kwon Dong-soo who oversaw the study said.This study is expected to contribute to reducing social costs related to cancer treatment along with developing the domestic soft endoscopy market which depends mainly on imports, KAIST said.Professor Kwon’s research team set up a firm called Easy Endo Surgical this year based on the core technology. The firm is developing various surgical robots, including K-FLEX. The team also won the Best Application Award and the Overall Winner at the Surgical Robot Challenge 2018 that opened in June in London.",KAIST conducts 1st surgery on live pig with flexible remote endoscopic robot,http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=3972
