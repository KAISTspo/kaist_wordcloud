"The season of the Nobel Prizes is back, and Koreans are once again expressing their long-lasting dream of rearing a Nobel Prize recipient in one of the fields of science (chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine). Thus far,  With the upcoming announcements of this year’s winners imminent (starting October 3), the National Research Foundation of Korea revealed recent survey results over predictions for potential winners. The survey, which was carried out by 144 of Korea’s core researchers in basic science, suggested Narry Kim (Kim Bitnaeri) as Korea’s most likely candidate for this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Kim, who is both a professor at Seoul National University and a senior researcher at the Institute for Basic Science, is renowned for her studies of microRNA. Other prominent potential recipients from Korea include KAIST professor Ryoo Ryong (chemistry), Harvard professor Philip Kim (physics), POSTECH professor Ihm Ji-soon, and SNU professor Hyeong Taeg-hwan. Internationally, the scholars picked physicists Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss as prospective winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics for their experiment with  (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). LIGO’s research team has been named several times as a prime candidate by various academics and media outlets, including Thomson Reuters. In the chemistry field,  researcher Yoshinori Ohsumi and UC Berkeley professor Jennifer Doudna, for developing -Cas9, were found to be popular candidates. The survey further revealed that 78 percent of respondents said that Korea is likely to see a winner in the scientific categories within the next 20 years. Of the respondents, 27 percent said that it would take approximately 6 to 10 years; 23 percent said in 11 to 15 years; and 22 percent, within 16 to 20 years. An additional 48 percent said that long-term support for a specific research field was most essential for nurturing a Nobel Prize recipient. The answer was followed by ‘support of research field that is challenging and adventurous’ (17 percent), and ‘maintaining consistency in Korea’s science and technology policies’ (14 percent).Meanwhile, although Korea has high levels of R&D expenditure relative to its GDP at 4.29 percent (2014), 75 percent of the spending was related to applied sciences for business, centered around conglomerates such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai, with research in basic sciences lacking.By Lina Jang ()",Does Korea Have a Chance at a Nobel Prize in Science?,http://koreabizwire.com/does-korea-have-a-chance-at-a-nobel-prize-in-science/67020
"A team of scientists at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) recently announced the development of technology that will allow for the mass production of carbon dioxide absorbents, which are used for post-combustion CO2 capture that could hypothetically help ease global warming resulting from excessive CO2 emissions.  Although there has been extensive research into amine-containing absorbents that chemisorb low-concentration CO2 from the atmosphere, these absorbents tend to lack efficiency in their desorption of the gas, and suffer from declined stability after repeated use. To overcome the setbacks, the team was able to dramatically increase the level of desorption and the reaction velocity by simply having the conventional amine-containing absorbent react to epoxide – a compound combined with carbon and oxygen. By making use of silicon dioxide and polyethyleneimine (PEI), a polyelectrolyte, the researchers were able to develop a new CO2 absorbent that “simultaneously exhibits a large CO2 working capacity as well as long-term stability in a TSA (temperature swing absorption) condition.”Following the research developments, the team successfully produced 20kg of the new CO2 absorbent in collaboration with the KCRC (Korea Carbon Capture & Sequestration R&D Center), and succeeded in using it in a test-bed environment. According to the team, if production can be increased to the scale of metric tons, the absorbent could also be used at thermoelectric power plants. “The development of CO2 absorbent remained at a laboratory standard, or at grams-level, but our latest development improved the potential for commercialization” said Dr. Choi Min-kee, who led the study. “We expect its commercialization within the next five years.”The full research findings were published in the August 30 online edition of Nature Communications.By Kevin Lee ()",Development of CO2 Absorbent Hints at Potential for Eco-Friendly Future,http://koreabizwire.com/development-of-co2-absorbent-hints-at-potential-for-eco-friendly-future/65988
"A research team from KAIST (the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) has developed a self-sealing hemostatic needle that won’t make you bleed after it’s used, taking advantage of one of Korea’s most popular mariculture products – mussels.  The team leveraged the exceptional ability of mussels to attach themselves to rocks on shore despite being battered by strong waves, and used an adhesive component extracted from their byssus as a coating material for syringe needles. Needles are essential in many branches of medicine. And although most healthy individuals can stem the flow of blood by applying pressure to a needle’s insertion point, patients with illnesses such as hemophilia tend to have difficulty doing so. For this reason, needles are often coated with hemostatic materials to help stop bleeding.According to the team, however, existing materials tended to show limitations in withstanding the force of friction during injection. The materials must have both the ability to firmly adhere to the surface of the needle, but also bond to either the skin or the wall of the blood vessel after injection, which is where mussels came into play. Mussels are able to stick to surfaces with their byssus, naturally produced filaments used for their adhesion. The newly developed needle is coated with partially crosslinked catechol-functionalized chitosan, extracted from a mussel’s byssus. When blood touches the coated material, it instantaneously undergoes a solid-to-gel process, immediately sealing the punctured tissue. The new development will be of benefit not only to patients with hemophilia, but also cancer and diabetes patients, and those with long-term use of aspirin, said professor Lee Hae-shin, who took part in the research.“We also expect synergy by combining the materials with other invasive medical equipment such as catheters or needles for bone biopsies.”By Joseph Shin ()",New Needle Won’t Make You Bleed,http://koreabizwire.com/new-needle-wont-make-you-bleed/67541

" (the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is measuring its students’ biosignals in an effort to prevent suicide. According to the university’s KI Health Science Research Institute, wearable devices that can measure biosignals were distributed to 350 students, starting in April. The institute is operating a pilot project that can predict certain health symptoms based on the devices’ signals.The university ethics commission approved the project, and the participating students signed consent forms to provide location and biometric data.The sensors on the wearable devices, such as smartwatches, smart shoes and shoe soles, and smart buckles, detect students’ biosignals, and the data is sent to a main server for consolidated maintenance. Biosignals include sleep state, heart rate, ECG, temperature, weight, and activity level. The data collected from the devices allows for the remote diagnosis of the students’ health. Cross-referencing school grades may even allow the institute to determine potential symptoms prior to suicide. The institute plans to compile a database using the information, which it plans to collect for the next two years. The school’s efforts to manage its students’ health mainly derived from a series of suicides that took place in 2011. The school has since opened an in-house stress clinic offering mental health examinations and counseling. However, continued incidents, including the suicide of graduate students last June, pushed the university to establish a system that  may help to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring.By Joseph Shin ()",Korean University to Collect Biosignals to Prevent Suicide,http://koreabizwire.com/korean-university-to-collect-biosignals-to-prevent-suicide/55572
"Many films worldwide continue to express womanhood in a stereotypical manner, a recent study has showed. — A research team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) announced on Monday that 40 movies from Hollywood and South Korea screened between 2017 and 2018 depicted women to be more prone to expressing passive emotions, such as sadness, fear, and surprise.In contrast, male characters in movies were more likely to demonstrate active emotions, such as anger and hatred.Female characters were less likely to appear in movies with automobiles than males (55.7 percent) while more likely to appear with furniture and in a household (123.9 percent).Female characters appeared less frequently in movies than males (56 percent) and were on average younger (79.1 percent). These comparisons were more vivid among South Korean films, the research team said.The research team used eight indices that they developed to conduct the study.The team used computer vision technology to compare levels of emotional diversity, spatial/temporal occupation, average age, impression of an intelligent character, emphasis on outward appearance, and the types and patterns of surrounding objects, which allowed for a successful analysis of how male and female characters were depicted in various movies in quantitative terms.The team downsampled movies from 24 frames to 3 frames per second, and used Microsoft’s facial recognition technology (Face API) to verify the gender, emotion, age, and location of the character on screen.The team then applied object detection technology to collect information on the types and location of the surrounding objects that appeared with the actors, which showed that most films depicted women from a stereotypical perspective.“Film is a form of media that can heavily influence audiences in their way of thinking,” said Prof. Lee Byeong-ju at KAIST who spearheaded the research team.“We should think twice before creating roles for male and female characters.”Lina Jang (linajang@koreabizwire.com)",Female Movie Characters More Prone to Stereotypes than Men,http://koreabizwire.com/female-movie-characters-more-prone-to-stereotypes-than-men/145953

"The Korean government will focus their efforts to promote 270 degree movies, thermoplastics, and fuel cells, according to an announcement from the third public-private meetings of the ‘Creative Economy.’ The meeting was held to draft a plan for a second flagship project.  According to plans for the second flagship project, the government will support the development of a new cinema system that shows movies not only on the main screen but also on the two side walls next to the main screen. The system is called ‘Screen X,’ and was invented by CJ and KAIST. The Screen X system provides an immersive panoramic viewing experience without requiring the use of any gadgets like 3D glasses. However, filmmakers will have to shoot with three cameras rolling simultaneously to benefit from the two new screens.Although no full-length films have been shot for the Screen X format so far, there are 75 Screen X applied screens in Korea. Short films and advertisements shot in the Screen X format have been shown on those screens. CJ and other private enterprises will further develop technology related to the the Screen X format, and build 20 more Screen X applied screens – 10 in Korea and 10 abroad.The second flagship project focuses on the PEEK (polyether ether ketone) industry. PEEK is a high performing semi-crystalline thermoplastic that is strong, stiff and has high temperature resistance. Hyosung, the South Korean industrial giant, has developed source technology to commercialize the use of PEEK, and is planning to increase its PEEK production capacity to 50,000 tons by the end of this year from the current 10,000 tons. Hyosung is also set to develop a huge line of PEEK products by 2020.The government will establish a certification system for green technology applied to PEEK production, and will support R&D related to PEEK technology for enterprises participating in the second flagship project.Another plan in the project is to revitalize the fuel cell industry.

"A team of Korean scientists led by KAIST professor Bae Hag-youl announced Thursday that it has developed a water-disposable, non-volatile resistive random access memory (RRAM) chip using a water soluble SSG (solid sodium with glycerine) paper.  In a nutshell, the device dissolves in a matter of seconds once it is placed in a small amount of water, making the data contained on the chip impossible to recover or replicate. With the advancement of technology, and the increased use of IoT devices, significant research has focused on developing more secure semiconductors that can best prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Conventional memory devices tend to take a longer time to destroy, while technology that uses paper boards to incinerate devices is limited by its need for a separate ignition mechanism and heat, the researchers said. According to the team, the new device can be dissolved within just ten seconds. The team also used an inkjet printing technique to overcome vulnerability to moisture and heat, preventing any damage from everyday humidity, and allowing the chip to only react to water. The team noted that its technology is applicable to a wide range of electronic devices, thanks to its flexibility, and the manufacturing cost is about one-tenth that of silicon-based options.The full research findings were published in the December 6 online edition of Scientific Reports.By Kevin Lee ()  ",Scientists Develop Water-Soluble Memory Chip,http://koreabizwire.com/scientists-develop-water-soluble-memory-chip/72728
"A group of South Korean scientists has developed new battery material, the science ministry said Monday, in what could bring significant changes to mobile devices and electronic cars.  The team led by Kang Jeong-ku of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) discovered a hybrid type of battery that can charge up to 100 times faster than lithium-ion batteries, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning said. Lithium-ion batteries have so far governed the global rechargeable battery market due to their outstanding energy and power capability. However, they have the weakness of taking too long to charge and discharge. As an alternative, a new storage mechanism called a supercapacitor was developed. These batteries, however, are much larger than conventional batteries for a given charge. The ministry said the new technology would have 1.5 times the capacity of lithium-ion batteries but at the same time have a similar size. “The latest development is forecast to be the centerpiece of electric cars and mobile devices in the future as they have stable energy capacity and can be charged at a relatively faster speed,” the team said. The research was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the findings were published in the journal “Advanced Energy Materials.”(Yonhap)",Scientists Develop Fast-Charging Battery,http://koreabizwire.com/scientists-develop-fast-charging-battery/67709
"Korea’s wearable thermo-element technology, which can recharge batteries through skin contact, was selected as one of the top innovations of the year by UNESCO. — The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology () announced on January 29 that its “wearable thermoelectric device” was selected as one of the top ten IT innovations at the 2015 Netexplo Awards, presented in partnership with UNESCO.The Netexplo Awards are given annually to tech inventions worldwide that have had a major influence on human life in areas such as energy, environment and education.Last April, Professor Cho Byung-jin and his research fellows developed the world’s first wearable element by realizing thermoelectric film on fiberglass. The wearable element can effectively generate electricity from human body heat, is very light and thin, and can easily be integrated into clothing.Wearable devices are expected to stand at the center of future electronics, but batteries that need to be recharged frequently consist of a challenging problem. With its minimal weight and high generation capability, the technology is rising as a key to solve the battery problem for wearable devices.In addition, it can be applied to a variety of devices generating waste heat, such as equipment in cars, planes and factories.

"A team of KAIST researchers announced Tuesday the development of a new emulsion technique that makes use of physical force instead of chemical compounds.  Because oil floats on water due to its lower density, dispersants, or surfactants, are required to make oil particles water-soluble. These compounds, however, have often been subject to criticism for their potential toxicity to humans, despite their frequent use in daily consumer products like cosmetics, medical supplies, and air fresheners. Instead of using a chemical treatment, the researchers triggered what is called a depletion force, which is an attraction force that usually occurs between  particles, by mixing polymer particles the size of several nanometers with larger solid particles the size of nano to micrometers. Although depletion attraction has only been observed between solid particles, the method employed by the KAIST researchers was able to generate the force required to successfully agglomerate oil droplets with larger particles.The final emulsion displayed enhanced particle absorption, while maintaining stability without the particles falling apart, the researchers said. “This is the first successful experiment to realize a depletion force between liquid droplets and solid particles,” said professor Kim Kyu-han, who led the study. “Because we formed an emulsion using physical force instead of a chemical application, the procedure can be used for nearly any kind of particle, and to make porous materials for different applications.”The team’s full research findings were published last month in Nature Communications. By Lina Jang ()",New Emulsion Technique Mixes Water and Oil without Chemicals,http://koreabizwire.com/new-emulsion-technique-mixes-water-and-oil-without-chemicals/75294

"A team of South Korean researchers has developed a new type of graphene for lithium-ion batteries that can be recharged at a faster rate than conventional ones with no risk of reduced capacity, they said Monday. Conventional graphene is a two-dimensional atom-thin sheet of carbon that is commonly produced by resolving graphite in a chemical solution and then later separating the ultra-thin sheet of carbon from the solution, according to the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Such methods, however, are bound to leave at least traces of foreign material on the sheet of carbon, a cause of reduced capacity over time. Unlike the conventional methods, the new way to create graphene has been developed by the KAIST team. It uses what is known as chemical vapor deposition to produce a three-dimensional sheet of carbon that is also free of impure elements.The lack of foreign elements allows it to be recharged at a much faster rate than conventional materials, the team said. A proving test has also confirmed no reduction in battery capacity even after 10,000 recharges, it added. “We believe it will help remove problems found in conventional lithium-ion batteries, while also enhancing their performance,” said KAIST Prof. Kang Jeong-koo, one of the two main developers in the team along with Prof. Kim Yong-hoon, who is also from the school.(Yonhap)",S.

"For the fifth weekend in a row, hundreds of thousands of Koreans took to the streets demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye, who is suspected of a host of illicit activities related to corruption and abuse of power. The latest protests, however, were noted by their integration with IT technologies, with protesters developing apps and services that can better facilitate nationwide demonstrations.  Among such services is a location-based mobile web page that offers college students a quick location guide to where their respective school members are gathered in crowds of thousands. The service takes into account the slow network speed at massive rallies, which has been the case for protests in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, and also features text-based location information that requires less Internet data. The site was developed by Park Hang, vice president of KAIST’s student body. He initially created the service exclusively for KAIST students, but recently expanded the service after requests from other university student bodies.“I decided to come up with the page after a few students told me it’s often difficult to find school members at protests,” he said. A mobile application called “Check Attendance” allows for a better estimate of the total number of protesters, by automatically checking in a person once they step into a 2-kilometer radius of the Gwanghwamun area. The app, according to the developer, was created to provide a better picture of the number of people gathered, given the discrepancies between police estimates and organizer claims. “At least a million lit up their candles for the country, but the police estimated the number at just 200,000,” said the developer. “It angered me, so I decided to create the app.” FireChat is a messaging app first introduced for the 2014 Hong Kong protests, but it’s now gaining popularity among Korean protesters seeking to avoid network paralysis. The app uses mesh networking, which works by using nearby smartphones’ Bluetooth or Wi-Fi links to relay messages, and is not affected by slow mobile networks. Among the most common mobile applications are of course the candlelight apps, which are apps that display candles on smartphone screens. They work best in wind and rain, or simply for those who forget to bring an actual candle out to a protest. They are also the perfect solution against the controversial remark by pro-Park Geun-hye lawmaker Kim Jin-tae, who said “candles are just candles, they will be blown out by the wind”.“The rally (on November 26) can be seen as the first of its kind that naturally integrated itself with information technology,” said a software science professor Chung Tae-myung at Sungkyunkwan University. “IT technology has made another step closer towards our livelihood, now affecting even rallies and protests.”By Kevin Lee ()  ",Korean Mass Protests Become “Smarter”,http://koreabizwire.com/korean-mass-protests-become-smarter/71001

"Former U.S. energy secretary Steven Chu said Thursday that South Korea’s current policy to do away with nuclear power is not a viable solution, and called for more concerted efforts to develop renewable energy. — “Nuclear is better than natural gas or coal… it’s a job of the government to educate the public and to weigh pros and cons of the health and economy,” the former official appointed by President Barack Obama said during a forum hosted by South Korea’s top engineering school Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).The Moon Jae-in administration earlier declared it will gradually curtail nuclear-generated power and replace it with more environmentally safe sources, such as solar and wind power. It hopes to raise the proportion of renewable energy to 20 percent of power produced by 2030.The Nobel prize-winning physicist said the Seoul government’s nuclear policy does not directly lead to the use of renewable energy as it focuses on burning coal.“Research in chemical energy storage through novel electrochemistry may lead to solutions, but for the next half century, we will need additional energy-on-demand, carbon-free sources of energy from proven technologies,” Chu pointed out.He also stressed the role of science in achieving a sustainable future, citing the case of the United Kingdom which has successfully built wind power.“While science, innovation and technology will no doubt lead to better solutions, sound government policies are needed to advance the transition to carbon-free energy needed to achieve a more sustainable world,” he said.Chu is known for his research at Bell Labs and Stanford University regarding the cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997.

"Antibiotics are often taken to ‘cure’ certain symptoms that occur in the human body, such as inflammation. They are often prescribed as necessary treatment since they work quickly and seem to show actual progress in curing illnesses, but controversy has clouded the usage of antibiotics and their effects for a considerable amount of time. – For the first time in the world, a Korean research team proved that when antibiotics are over-prescribed, the balance between the microorganisms living in our bodies could be broken, and the ability to defend the body from illnesses is lowered.The research team led by professor Lee Heung-gyu at KAIST announced that they had identified the mechanism through which the imbalance of symbiotic microorganisms in the body could influence the immune system when defending against herpes.The results were published in the online January issue of the international science journal ‘Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences’ (PNAS).Symbiotic microorganisms are microorganisms that coexist in the human body, playing various roles to maintain health. An imbalance in the microorganisms can cause inflammable intestine illnesses, as well as allergies, diabetes and cancer.When the research team injected lab rats with antibiotics, they observed an imbalance of microorganisms. Helpful microorganisms decreased and harmful microorganisms that could not exist in a natural state increased.When the same rats were then infected with herpes, they died earlier than other rats that were not injected with antibiotics.The research team anticipated that the results of the research would raise awareness on the harm antibiotics can cause to the human body.However, antibiotics are everywhere. They are not only injected into humans to treat illnesses, but they are also injected into livestock that ends up on our dinner tables.According to a Chinese publication, antibiotics for animals were detected in 80 percent of Chinese children.When the research team analyzed the urine of children between the ages of eight and 11, 21 different types of antibiotics used on animals were detected in 79.6 percent of the children.The problem is that the incidence of animal antibiotics was directly related to obesity among children.Low density antibiotics led to a 1.99 point higher risk of obesity, and the presence of mid to high density antibiotics resulted in children three times more likely to be obese.With multiple reports from around the world alerting to the dangers of antibiotics, it is time for governments to take steps to safeguard their citizens.By Francine Jung ()",Antibiotics: More Harm than Help?,http://koreabizwire.com/antibiotics-more-harm-than-help/50334
"Just past noon on a recent Monday, a 30-something woman entered a small brick-and-mortar shop in the heart of Seoul, the kind of commonly seen convenience store in South Korea that sells a little bit of everything. — Except, it was locked until the shopper tagged her credit card on a reader placed next to the door to get in. She had no human contact in the course of her visit that lasted three minutes or so, during which time she picked up some snacks, paid with her credit card and left.The shop at the Westin Chosun hotel is one of four unmanned convenience stores run by emart24, an affiliate of leading discount store chain operator Shinsegae, which opened in September amid local retailers’ efforts to find a breakthrough in the saturated market.While it mostly looks like any other 24-hour shop, a closer look reveals some differences between it and outlets with a clerk.There is no alcohol, and cigarettes are sold through a vending machine. Self-service kiosks, where guests scan the bar codes of their items, automatically reject products that are past their sell-by dates.The country’s first cashierless convenience store broke onto the retail scene in May, when 7-Eleven unveiled a shop that utilizes vein recognition technology at South Korean retail giant Lotte’s 123-story skyscraper.At present, only people using certain payment systems, such as credit cards issued by the business group’s financial arm, can enter the store after a prior registration.Automated stores belonging to emart24, on the other hand, allow access and payment with any credit card, though they could be more susceptible to robbery.BGF Retail Co., the operator of South Korea’s largest convenience store chain, CU, is also attempting to tap into the emerging business with a mobile application called CU Buy-Self, which allows customers to pay on their own.The app has been on a beta run at its outlet in Seongnam, south of Seoul, since last week and the company plans to expand the service nationwide by the first half of next year.“It currently plays a supportive role in running our store, but we believe it will ultimately be the starting point for the realization of cashierless convenience stores,” said Lee Eun-kwan, head of the company’s management innovation department.Industry watchers say it will take some time for the new type of stores to fully replace conventional ones, mainly due to security reasons.“It seems the new cashierless stores are still at a self-service stage, rather than an automation stage,” said industrial and systems engineering professor Lee Tae-eog at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).“Unless retailers find the technology to minimize the possibility of theft to near zero, they won’t be able to adopt the system nationwide,” he said.Indeed, emart24 operates a separate team at its headquarters to monitor the four unmanned stores 24 hours a day via CCTV.“We will focus on improving the overall system, including the security issues, before we roll out a further expansion plan,” an emart24 official said.Yet many experts say the appearance of such experimental shops is a sign of things to come and that it is about time to seriously talk about how to face the new era of automation and its effects on the job market.The race to take a lead in the next generation retail model is gathering steam in part because of the government’s push to increase the minimum hourly wage to 10,000 won (US$9.29) by 2020.In July, the government decided to raise the minimum wage by 16.4 percent to 7,530 won per hour next year, marking the biggest jump in nearly two decades.“For retailers, labor costs constitute a big part in running their businesses,” professor Lee said. “They cannot just sit idle when all the other competitors are putting more and more resources into automation,” he said.“There will be simply less work for humans to do, and those low-paid workers doing simple tasks will be the first to be hit,” the professor added.Lee Ga-hyun, who heads the Arbeit Workers’ Union, a civic group for part-time employees, urged the government to put more effort into protecting workers’ job security.“We held a couple of discussion sessions over the issue, and many of our members actually express concerns over whether they will be able to keep their positions and whether it will become more difficult to find a job,” she said.“Some people maintain an optimistic stance, saying new jobs will be created along the way, but it is still vague whether that work will be distributed to people of all strata,” the activist added.Lee Nam-sin, director of the Korean Contingent Workers’ Center, suggested that all relevant parties, including the government, sit down together and come up with a consensus on how and to what extent automation should be adopted.The director, who represented laborers at the trilateral council of labor, management and the general public for next year’s minimum wage negotiations, said all the burden will be placed on the workers in the absence of such talks.“The move for a more automated society is an irreversible trend at this point,” director Lee said. “The question is how to make a soft landing.”(Yonhap)",S.

"A South Korean research team has developed an eco-friendly generator that absorbs small amounts of water from the atmosphere to generate electricity. — Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) found that if a small amount of water (0.15 ml) is dropped on one side of cotton fiber coated with conductive carbon particles, the hydrogen ions in the water move from the wet side to the dry side, causing an electric current to flow.This is a principle in which a small amount of electrical energy is generated by the voltage difference caused by hydrogen ion absorption between wet and dry areas.Furthermore, the researchers found that since hydrogen ions move slowly, they can generate electricity for an hour before the cotton dries completely.Since all water evaporates, the generator eventually stops producing electricity, Thus, one must drop water periodically to keep generating electricity.In order to continuously supply water, researchers used calcium chloride, a deliquescent substance which absorbs water from the atmosphere and slowly dissipates.When a cotton fiber coated with carbon is covered with calcium chloride, it is found that the cotton will absorb moisture voluntarily in an environment with 20 percent humidity and maintain power.The researchers succeeded in turning on a 20mW LED light bulb with 0.15ml of water using a generator that was developed with the process mentioned.Unlike other eco-friendly power sources such as solar and wind, which are constrained by environmental factors, the research team explained that in environments with humidity of 20 percent or higher, electricity can be generated without adding any water.“The generator, including the deliquescent substance, has shown the ability to produce power for more than two weeks in a typical atmospheric environment,” said Kim Il-doo, the KAIST professor who led the research team.“This technology can be used for wearable devices that develop using sweat from our bodies and for power generators for the Internet of Things.”Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",Eco-friendly Generator Produces Electricity from Water,http://koreabizwire.com/eco-friendly-generator-produces-electricity-from-water/149684
"New technology for an OLED mask that fits closely to the face has been developed by a South Korean research team. — A joint research team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital said Wednesday that it has developed a thin and flexible “freeform” OLED for phototherapy.Phototherapy is a treatment that uses light to promote internal biochemical reactions. LED masks and laser devices are major phototherapy devices.Although LED mask technology is receiving attention for its role in skin regeneration processes such as healing wounds and improving wrinkles, current LED masks have limitations.It is difficult to develop LEDs that distribute light uniformly and can adhere to the skin.The research team has produced freeform OLEDs that can adhere not only to the skin but also to cloth and paper by using displays that are thin, flexible and have uniform light-emitting properties.The new displays have a sandwich structure, with a thin OLED placed between two layers of thicker film, and can be attached to the surface of various materials as their overall thickness is 10 micrometers.Thin film layers were manufactured by combining barrier layers, plastics and adhesives that completely seal the display to protect from exposure to moisture and oxygen.The research team tested the freeform OLEDs on mice that had keratinocyte cells removed and then shone the light on them in 10-minute sessions. The results showed that the cells were 21 percent regenerated eight days later.The control group without any phototherapy did not regenerate any of the keratinocytes.In addition, as a result of applying freeform OLEDs to artificial skin models made of human skin cells, the skin that received phototherapy was more than 30 percent thicker than the control group that did not receive phototherapy.A thicker epidermis means skin has regenerated.The freeform OLEDs worked normally despite 1,000 repeated folds, and their lifespan was maintained for more than 1,000 hours after washing, the team explained.“The new OLEDs can be used in wearable devices for phototherapy attached to clothes or hats as well as mask packs for skin beauty and patches for healing wounds,” said KAIST professor Choi Kyung-cheol, who led the research team.Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",Researchers Develop OLED Mask Technology,http://koreabizwire.com/researchers-develop-oled-mask-technology/149876
"New technology has been developed that allows diesel-powered delivery trucks to be equipped with hybrid engines that can increase fuel efficiency while reducing emissions. — The Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Green Transportation at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said Monday that it had completed a system that can carry electric batteries and a drive system in diesel engines for cargo trucks weighing less than 1.5 tons, which are typically used by parcel delivery companies.The research team succeeded in efficiently distributing power while modifying the manual transmission and making parts lighter.The researchers developed a thin drive motor and inserted the part into a narrow gap, about 14 centimeters between the engine and the transmission in the existing drive system.As a result of applying this technology to three trucks that are more than five years old, the change was hardly noticeable on the surface.The research team is currently conducting the first road tests on Jeju Island to confirm the safety of the technology. It is examining the quantity emissions as well as the impact of the mechanical changes on braking and steering.The researchers believe the system will ultimately improve combined fuel efficiency by 30 percent and reduce fine dust emissions by 20 percent. The goal is to commercialize the system at a cost of less than 5 million won (US$4,300) per vehicle.The research team is planning to carry out demonstration work at KAIST’s Environment-friendly Smart Auto Research Center by next year.“The vehicle weight increase for this highly efficient and eco-friendly technology does not exceed 100 kilograms,” said Kim Kyung-soo, Dean of the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Green Transportation.Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",New Tech Transforms Diesel Delivery Trucks into Hybrid Vehicles,http://koreabizwire.com/new-tech-transforms-diesel-delivery-trucks-into-hybrid-vehicles/147573
"The actual Winter Games are at least a month away, but that hasn’t stopped the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics from rewriting history right now. – On a chilly December day, the crowd gathered at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon were treated to an unusual sight; not one, but two robots serving as Olympic torch bearers.The first runner, DRC-HUBO, arrived on scene in the driver’s seat of a self-driving car with American roboticist Dennis Hong of UCLA riding shotgun. Wearing an Olympic flag-themed beanie on its head, HUBO was greeted to cheers and applause from the excited onlookers.A humanoid robot designed by a research collective called Team KAIST, HUBO can mimic a variety of human movements ranging from dancing to shaking a person’s hand. It brought itself and its engineering team global recognition when it took first place in the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge that was held from 2012 through 2015. By accomplishing eight tasks the fastest amongst all other contestants, HUBO raised the profile of South Korean robotics technology internationally. After Hong passed on the Olympic flame, HUBO pressed forward and successfully transported the fire to the next runner, its “father”, professor Oh Joon-ho, the leader of Team KAIST. Despite the obstacle that was placed in front of it as a test, HUBO maneuvered the roadblock with ease. HUBO was only one half of the spectacle on this day, as only a few dozen meters down the road stood a 270kg robot over 2 meters tall.Named the FX-2, what differentiated this robot from HUBO was the 14-year old young man sitting on the chair that composed the FX-2′s upper body. Designed specifically for the Winter Games according to the Olympics organizing committee, the FX-2 can be described simplistically as a giant walking chair with arms.Its predecessor, the FX-1, was of a similar build, but was limited in two key ways: It was built to move around indoors, and it did not have the two “data-arms” that the person in the passenger seat can control. These two arms can perform similar functions to that of human appendages, and are also equipped with five fingers each that can bend or flex. Lee Jung-jae, the pilot of the bot and the winner of a software development competition for youth, showed an example of these capabilities by shifting the Olympic torch from the robot’s left to right hand. The Olympic flame was eventually passed to the next human in line without incident.Broadcast live on YouTube and Facebook, the majority of comments regarding the two robots’ performance were positive, though some criticized the sounds the machines generated or South Korean robotics technology as “still far from where the United States is at”.S.B.W.

"A mask that can be reused and still maintain its filtering function after being washed more than 20 times has been developed. — Much attention is paid on whether the new mask filter can solve the problem mask shortages amid the growing coronavirus outbreak.A team of researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said Monday they have developed a nanofiber filter that maintains filter efficiency even after washing with an “Insulated Block Electrospinning” method that intersects or aligns nanofiber at right angles in a cross-shaped pattern.The existing melt blown filters are non-woven, randomly intertwined fibers, with varying pore sizes, and require multiple filters to be overlaid to block even small particles.In addition, static electricity formed on the surface of the fiber disappears when it touches moisture, and after a certain period of time, the efficiency of the filter decreases drastically when it is washed or worn.The new filter is made by crossing fine nanofiber at right angles or by tightly aligning fibers in a row, with smaller and equally spaced air holes.This allows the same blocking efficiency with less thickness than conventional filters. The masks are airy and make it easy to breathe as well.Even after washing with ethanol or soap several times, the particle blocking function was maintained.Although the team hand-washed the filter more than 20 times with soap and immersed it in an ethanol solution for more than three hours, the structure of the filter remained unchanged and the performance remained at 94 percent compared to the initial performance.Furthermore, the mask was still able to block particles better than a KF80 mask even after it was folded and bent more than 4,000 times.The team also developed cotton mask that can make use of the reusable filters.When considering the masks and filters can be washed with ethanol spray or soap and reused 10 to 20 times, people can live a month, or even longer, with two to three filters.A KAIST startup company established in February of last year can produce a filter sheet 35 centimeters wide and 7 meters long in an hour. Using this method, the company can manufacture an average of 1,500 mask filters per day.Professor Kim Il-doo of KAIST, who led the research team, said, “The mask can be reused with ethanol disinfection or light hand washing, which will solve the environmental problem caused by the loss of masks and the disposal of masks.”“We plan to expand the facilities for mass production by using related procedures such as approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety,” he added.D.

"As more children are exposed to digital technologies from an early age, a growing number of tech-savvy parents are looking for toys that can help make their kids more creative and smarter. — After searching for an answer for a fun, easy and expandable toy, RoboRisen, a Korean robot startup, developed a smartphone-connected modular robot named PingPong: to serve as a playmate and a teacher for kids in a more engaging way.RoboRisen founder and CEO Yim Sang-bin said the single-module based platform can easily create hundreds of robots and provides an opportunity to enjoy entertainment at affordable prices.“My goal was to create an easy and fun robot that can be a lifelong friend for all ages,” Yim said during an interview with Yonhap News at the firm’s Seoul office.“As PingPong is an open platform, it can be transformed into any form depending on the users’ levels.”Yim, a former researcher of the KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) robot team, introduced PingPong earlier this year after two years of development and launched 13 educational kits for schools in August.The company plans to release a dozen more models via Wadiz, Korea’s largest crowdfunding platform, later this month to expand its customer base, he said.PingPong’s entry level cube starts at 55,000 won (US$46.40) and packages for coding and other software education cost around 140,000 won on a local e-commerce site.The 47-year-old robot scientist, who also runs a local education company supplying coding tools for about 2,000 schools over the past 12 years, decided to start a new business to create a robot that overcomes limitations of the current models used in schools.With his expertise in the robot industry and know-how in the educational toy market, Yim focused on a robot platform that can be used by all ages, ranging from kindergartens to colleges, and even for adult hobbyists.“Advanced models are expensive and complicated to assemble, while cheaper robot toys are too simple and make kids get easily bored with limited forms,” Yim said.“PingPong solved many technical problems by making it possible to construct running, crawling and walking robots with a single module and linkable to other platforms.”Each cube has a central processing unit (CPU), battery, motor and sensors. By combining cubes and links, the user is able to build any robot they want within several minutes, he said.Controlling hundreds of cubes with a single smartphone is also possible with Bluetooth networking technology, and users can charge them simultaneously with just one charging port.“We put in advanced technologies to make it simple and easy,” Yim said. “I would say it’s the pinnacle of minimalism.”The 36-millimeter square modules were designed to fit into the hands of his two sons, then aged 6 and 10 in 2017, the main target customer of the robot.“I was lucky to have potential customers at home, who now play well with the robots,” he said.Although the black-and-yellow cubic cell’s design is plain, users can make their own covers with a 3-D printer to decorate it or create links to connect with other modules.“With a 3-D printer, you can create different links between the modules and customize the cover design,” he said.Despite its foolproof structure, Yim said the robot can become an educational tool for advanced software courses in colleges as it is built on an open platform, the firm said.The startup has been talking applications for PingPong for an engineering course curriculum with faculty members at KAIST and the University of Oxford in England, while exploring ways to collaborate with LG Electronics Inc. to apply its artificial intelligence (AI) in its robot platform.“Expandability is important for educational robots used in schools to meet demands for different educational programs,” Yim said. “Starting at the beginner level, it can be used in curriculums for engineering college students.”The CEO said the company will focus on distributing the robot in local schools first and expand the presence in the global educational toy market.As part of efforts, RoboRisen will promote its robots in major tech and education fairs at home and abroad next year, including the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona slated in the first two months of next year.Though still in an early stage in the market, PingPong has received several awards for its innovative design and engineering technology, including the CES 2020 Innovation Award.The company said it plans to release a full lineup of the robots and educational tool kits in collaboration with other partners, aiming to generate 50 billion won of sales by 2023.“I want to make PingPong a new standard in robot entertainment, software education and the robotics market,” Yim said.(Yonhap)",RoboRisen Targets Educational Toy Market with App-based Modular Robot,http://koreabizwire.com/roborisen-targets-educational-toy-market-with-app-based-modular-robot/149076
"A Korean scientist has succeeded in curing Parkinson’s disease using a patient’s own stem cells for the first time in history. — Prof. Kim Kwang-soo of McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School and his research team announced Tuesday that they had succeeded in a clinical treatment of transplanting stem cells extracted from the patient’s skin into the brain.Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by the death of cells in charge of generating enough dopamine. The symptoms involve shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.Prof. Kim, a graduate of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), used an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) to turn the patient’s skin cells into those that produce dopamine to cure Parkinson’s disease without any negative immune response.Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPS cells, capable of reverting adult cells into primitive form, are made using adult cells, which poses no risk of ethical issues or negative immune response.George Lopez, a former doctor who received the treatment, has regained enough motor capabilities to tie his shoes, swim and ride a bicycle.For the first time in history, iPS cells were used to successfully treat a brain disease, the research team explained.This treatment requires creating a stable stem cell using the patient’s somatic cells, and raising efficiency high enough to turn them into dopamine cells.The treatment is known to be a particularly difficult process since it also needs to avoid any side-effects or harm.In 2011, the research team developed the world’s first iPS cell generation technology and succeeded in an animal test. In 2017, the dopamine neural cell was transplanted into Dr. Lopez’s brain.Since then, a series of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed that the clinical test turned out to be successful.“We need to conduct more clinical tests on more patients for approved safety and effectiveness,” said Prof. Kim. “We will strive to make stem cell treatment the approved method in treating Parkinson’s disease.”The research was published in last month’s edition of New England Journal of Medicine.H.

"South Korea’s top-ranked science and technology university has developed a new technology that can get rid of the novel coronavirus in the air. — The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) announced on Wednesday that it had developed electrostatic atomization technology that can create a massive amount of ultra-fine water drops for the sterilization of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the air.Contained in the ultra-fine water drops that have a micrometer/nanometer-level size is a hydroxyl radicals (also known as OH radicals), a material that ranks second behind fluorine in terms of sterilization and disinfection strength.OH radicals have stronger sterilization and disinfection capability than ozone and chlorine. Unlike them, however, OH radicals have no toxic effect as they are harmless to the human body.The lifespan of OH radicals, however, is shortened in the air. The KAIST research team addressed the problem by caging OH radicals within a water drop.At present, Japanese tech giant Panasonic Corp. is known to be a global leader in the field of OH radical-containing ultra-fine water drop technology.Panasonic’s technology, however, has limits since it generates ozone, which is harmful to the human body, due to its higher impressed voltage and a shortage in the amount of water drops.The research team succeeded in mass-producing the ultra-fine water drops by using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology to create an ultra-fine nozzle made of polymer that is thinner than a hair.With low impressed voltage, this technology can stably realize the electrostatic atomization without generating ozone.“This is an eco-friendly technology using pure water that is completely safe for humans,” said Lee Seung-sup, the professor who led the research team.J.

"South Korea is set to resume work on two nuclear reactors on the southeastern coast after a three-month hiatus, as a state commission gave the green light to complete construction Friday and which is expected to affect the government’s nuclear phase-out plan. — The construction of the Shin Kori-5 and Shin Korea-6 in Ulsan, 414 kilometers southeast of Seoul, has been put on hold since July 14 as the government wanted to assess public opinion to decide on their fate, the first such action taken by the country.The commission’s recommendation based on surveys of a 471-member civilian jury and several rounds of public debates relieved anxieties felt by local companies involved in the project. However, it is viewed as delaying the drive by Seoul to push forward its new renewable energy initiative to wean South Korea away from atomic energy.Although President Moon Jae-in pledged to abandon the project during the election campaign, local contractors and residents have strongly opposed the move and threatened to take legal action to obtain financial compensation.A consortium led by the state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP) has already spent 1.6 trillion won (US$1.4 billion) on the project that began last year, with construction already being 30 percent complete.The KHNP said it will take the necessary steps to resume construction after the committee’s recommendation is accepted during a Cabinet meeting set for Tuesday.“Once we receive the official documents from the government, we will notify contractors of the decision and push for the resumption of construction based on changed contract terms, which were delayed due to the temporary suspension,” the KHNP said.The KHNP estimated the financial damage on local contractors to be about 100 billion and set out a plan to use reserve funds to compensate them.The intensely debated issue, which was decided by a margin of 19 percentage points in favor of resuming the work, highlights differing views between the government’s renewable energy push and established industries that prefer nuclear power to meet the country’s needs for cheap electric power.Those who support the reactors said the government should reflect the committee’s recommendation when it draws a broader energy roadmap, which is due later this year.“The construction was underway in accordance with the due process. Taking the issue to a public debate could hurt the credibility of the government’s policy,” Jung Yong-hun, a professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST), said. “The committee’s call for resuming the construction sends a message that the government should reconsider its nuclear-free policy.”Although the three-month deliberative process focused on the fate of the two reactors under construction, experts stressed the need to continue open discussions on the future of the country’s energy policy.“I think there was consensus that aborting the project could create a huge fallout because such a move involves financial compensation and legal procedures, as well as employment problems,” Roh Dong-seok, a senior researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute, said.“As the committee sided with resumption (of construction), the government should come up with policies to ease public concerns. Public debates of far wider breadth and depth should continue on how to design the energy mix for a sustainable power supply.”South Korea relies on imported resources to meet 95 percent of its energy needs, while 24 reactors generate about 30 percent of its electricity.With four new plants nearly completed, the Moon administration has abandoned a plan to build four more and pushed for an early closure of the Wolsong-1 unit, now the nation’s oldest reactor.Although renewable sources like solar and wind have grown in popularity in recent years, experts say the local infrastructure and research levels are still in their early stages.They have urged the government to greatly expand investment in infrastructure for eco-friendly energy and ease regulations on new facilities, while calling for consistent policy implementation of long-term goal.(Yonhap)",Resumption of Construction for 2 Nuclear Reactors to Affect Gov’t Plan,http://koreabizwire.com/resumption-of-construction-for-2-nuclear-reactors-to-affect-govt-plan/98379

"A research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has developed an unmanned aerial vehicle with separately controlled wings.The researchers, led by professors Ha Dong-soo and Jo Cheon-sik, said on Thursday that they had developed a new drone that features main wings that be controlled separately, allowing for a smooth transition between vertical flight and level flight.Typically, drones are divided into two main groups, one with fixed wings and the other with propeller blades.Drones with fixed wings often use all-in-one wings to create lift by using air flow for better energy efficiency, but lack swiftness due to a large radius of gyration, whereas drones with multiple propellers lag behind on the energy efficiency front.Against this backdrop, Professor Ha’s team has invented a new type of drone that flies with twin separately controlled main wings, and also comes with a motor on its tail.According to the researchers, there are two ways to gain separate control of the wings.Support can be provided for the fuselage and wings of a drone, together as well as separately, or the sides of the fuselage can be employed as part of a control device to provide individual support to each wing.Professor Ha’s team took the former approach, creating a new drone with wings that can be controlled individually while an accompanying sensor attached to the body will help adjust the movement of the aerial vehicle.As a result, the new drone is capable of various movements often impossible for regular airplanes, such as a smooth transition between vertical flight and level flight, according to the researchers.Since 2016, the research team has been patenting its separate wing control method from an early stage of development in the U.S. and China as well as in South Korea.“Separate wing control system for small and medium-sized aerial vehicles have not been trialed even in leading countries. We hope to see (the new development) used in a wide range of fields including air transport, safety management and air weapons for military purposes,” Ha said.

"When people hear the words “virtual reality” (VR), most would think of video games with awkward VR headsets. Some would think of “The Matrix,” the movie where the main character, Neo, realizes that his reality is actually a computer simulation and that the Matrix is a VR version of the world designed to keep the human race passive. — Only a few years ago, VR — which works by tracking a user’s head movements in a simulated three-dimensional world — was a niche business, as the gadgets were not only expensive but cumbersome to use.Now, numerous vendors, including big names in the industry such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Facebook-owned Oculus, have released cost-effective headsets and opened up new possibilities by expanding the market beyond the gaming and entertainment sectors to various industries ranging from automotive and military to health care.The Korea VR Festival 2017, which ran from Saturday to Wednesday at the Sangam Digital Media Complex business district in western Seoul, was a chance to experience the latest VR technologies and to take a glimpse at how virtual reality can impact ordinary lives now and in the future.The event, co-hosted by the Ministry of Science and the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), brought together nearly 200 VR manufacturers and suppliers from both home and abroad.“Imagine doctors operating on a patient in a VR operating theater (where) they will be able to see the procedures in advance,” said Joo Il-young of mid-sized tech firm SolidEng Inc. “These far-fetched ideas that seem to be so far from reality are actually already happening today.”The company has joined forces with the country’s top engineering university, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), to apply VR technology to hip joint surgery. MRI data is used to build up a 3D image of a hip joint so that the advantages and disadvantages of various surgical methods can be examined before surgery actually takes place.“Doctors will be able to make surgical plans through the VR navigation system to confirm the optimal procedure,” said Joo, adding that this method can enhance a patient’s recovery by giving surgeons the ability to carry out trial runs.The country’s top-notch Seoul National University Hospital in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, just south of the capital, is one of a few hospitals combining medicine and VR technology. For the first time in the country, the hospital has begun training medical staff with VR.The hospital said it provides surgical experience to their interns, who view recorded videos of real surgeries through headsets. VR training improves their initial skills, and a simulation-based tests make it possible to ensure the basic competency of junior surgeons before they actually proceed to treating patients.Increasingly a large number of carmakers are also using VR technology to test safety features, and to design their products to be as safe as possible and of the quality the customer expects before they actually hit the production line. Many manufacturers are starting to offer various VR-based services.Hyundai AutoEver, an IT arm of South Korea’s largest automaker Hyundai Motors Co., has joined with Z-storm Inc. to develop a VR program that allows people to sit inside a specific vehicle model without actually riding the car itself.The so-called “Digital Showroom” gives people a real steering wheel with which to drive the virtual car, allowing users to experience the model as if they were sitting in it. The company currently provides the VR experience for Hyundai’s latest subcompact SUV Kona and plans to add more models.The latest gathering was also an opportunity to see how the military is incorporating VR technology to train soldiers and other military personnel by giving them experiences ranging from vehicle and flight simulations to battlefield situations.The Korea Military Academy, which trains future officers, showcased a weapons simulator that reproduces real ballistic trajectories to improve the effectiveness of firearms training. The school has begun developing its indigenous VR technologies by working with the Ministry of Science and ICT.“I think simulating the actual battlefield for soldiers who will be facing combat is probably the most difficult area in which VR can prepare troops,” said Seo Jae-hoon, an ex-serviceman and businessman who tried the academy’s VR simulator.According to a report by industry tracker IHS, the global VR market is about to become mainstream and could surpass US$ 40 billion by 2020. Currently, VR hardware accounts for the largest share of the market, with the software sector forecast grow at the highest rate.Gaming and entertainment are currently still the most common uses for the medium.

The new processor can also deliver both convolutional and recurrent neural networks simultaneously.“It is meaningful that the research team developed the processor that can be activated at low power to realize the AI technology,” said Yoo, who is a professor of electrical engineering.The research was funded by the ministry and was announced during the annual International Solid-State Circuits Conference.(Yonhap)",Scientists Develop Energy-Efficient AI Processor,http://koreabizwire.com/scientists-develop-energy-efficient-ai-processor/112213
"The right timing for talking is more difficult than it appears. — This is because the context can differ depending on the mood of counterparts or the surrounding environment.A South Korean research team has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables AI assistants to know when it is an appropriate time to talk.The Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) announced on Wednesday that it found contextual factors in user circumstances that determine the optimal timing for smart speakers to talk.After developing smart speakers for experimental use, the research team installed them in the rooms of 40 students who live in campus dormitories and collected as many as 3,500 data records over a period of a week.As part of the experiment, the smart speakers asked if it was okay to talk when the user’s motion was detected or when a certain amount of time had passed. In response, the students answered and explained why.With this experiment, the circumstance contextual factors that determine when the smart speakers should start or stop talking were classified into personal factors, social factors and motion factors.Personal factors, for instance, can be divided into the degree of concentration on activities, the degree of urgency and busyness, the state of mental and physical condition, and the state of being able to talk or listen.The research team expects the new technology to contribute to developing new AI assistants that can offer preemptive services such as reminding users to take medication or modifying schedules based on the actual progress of planned tasks.Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",New Technology Developed to Get AI Assistant Talk Timing Right,http://koreabizwire.com/new-technology-developed-to-get-ai-assistant-talk-timing-right/173316

"A South Korean research team has developed a new artificial-intelligence chip capable of deep learning that could be used in future mobile phones, robots and drones. The researchers, led by professor Yu Hoe-jun at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, announced on Monday that they had revealed findings from their study last week at Hot Chips, a symposium on high performance chips which was held in San Jose.The semiconductor chip, also known as a deep neural network processing unit (DNPU), is capable of a number of AI-based tasks including object and action recognition as well as image captioning, which explains images in text, all of which fall under the category of deep learning.As part of machine learning, deep learning is technology that allows computers to learn things on their own, including recognizing the owner of a device, and turning images into text.The research team claims the energy efficiency of their DNPU is up to four times greater than the tensor processing unit which was used in Google’s famous AI computer program AlphaGo, which plays the board game Go.In addition, unlike a TPU, which relies on data center servers to process deep learning, the DNPU chip can complete the task from devices like mobiles, robots and drones.Hot Chips, where the findings from the study were first unveiled, is an academic platform where IT giants like Intel, Google and Microsoft have revealed groundbreaking advances.This year, KAIST and Harvard University took part in the symposium. Ashley Song (ashley@koreabizwire.com)",KAIST Develops New AI Chip Capable of Deep Learning,http://koreabizwire.com/kaist-develops-new-ai-chip-capable-of-deep-learning/93050
"Lee Se-dol, a top-class Go player from South Korea, is known for his exceptional strategy and skills at the ancient board game, but at the same time, he is also known for his provocative comments toward his opponents. – That hasn’t changed even though this time, his challenger isn’t human.Lee, who has won 18 world titles, said on Monday that he is confident of beating Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo. In a five-game match set for next month, the 32-year-old South Korean expects to win by a score of 5-0 or 4-1.“It didn’t take long for me to make the decision (to play) because I was so curious about AlphaGo,” Lee said Monday. “I only thought about five minutes (before accepting the offer).”The historic man-versus-computer showdown is scheduled for Mar. 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul. Demis Hassabis, the CEO of the AlphaGo developer Google DeepMind, said the algorithm’s programmer will place the markers on the board after watching AlphaGo’s moves from a monitor.The winner of the five-game challenge will receive US$1 million. If AlphaGo wins, the money will be donated to UNICEF and other charities.AlphaGo surprised the Go community after shutting out European Go champion Fan Hui 5-0 last October. But Lee, who went pro at the age of 12, said the result doesn’t make him nervous.“Looking at the match in October, I think (AlphaGo’s) level doesn’t match mine,” Lee said. “Of course, there would have been many updates in the last four or five months, but that isn’t enough time to challenge me.” However, Lee, who acquired Go’s highest level of ninth dan in 2003, acknowledged that any games against the AI will be very close in a few years.“If artificial intelligence continues to advance, probably in a year or two years, it will be really hard to guess the results,” he said.Go, known as “baduk” in South Korea, originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players alternately putting black and white stones on a checkerboard-like grid. The object is to have larger territories than the opponent by surrounding vacant areas of the board using their stones.Fellow Go players have predicted that Lee will prevail against AlphaGo.“I was first surprised that an artificial intelligence program has advanced enough to challenge pro Go players,” said Lee Chang-ho, who has won 21 world Go events. “It will be an interesting matchup, but I think Lee Se-dol will win.” Yoo Chang-hyuk, a ninth dan Go player with 24 titles, including six international tournaments, offered a more careful prediction in the human brain versus computer algorithm matchup.“Lee Se-dol will have an easy win if AlphaGo’s level is the same as what was shown against Fan Hui,” Yoo said. “But we don’t know how much AlphaGo has progressed since then.”Ke Jie, the top Chinese player who defeated Lee last month, said the South Korean was “too modest” when he predicted a victory by 4-1 or 5-0.“I’m not perfectly sure about this, but I’m going to say that Lee would win by 5-0 according to that game (between AlphaGo and Fan Hui) last October,” Ke was quoted as saying by Xinhua News Agency. “It is said that AlphaGo is learning all the time… so it is hard to say what the AI would be like in three months. (But) barring any unforeseen circumstances, Lee would win anyway.”Ke predicted AI would eventually beat human players one day.“AI has been developing at a fast pace,” he said. “We the pros have paid a lifetime effort to reach the height we’ve got today, but we have to reconcile with it when the day comes.”Regardless of the result, scientists are saying the match marks a significant occasion where an AI can challenge a human brain, and it will lead to further advances in the development of human-like algorithms.“Now, just like humans, an AI can learn from experience and draw inferences to make up strategies,” said Jeong Jae-seung, a bio and brain engineering professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). “This matchup will open a new chapter in the history of AI regardless of the result.”(Yonhap)",S.

"Korean researchers have developed Ultra Low Power (ULP) augmented reality (AR) glasses that can detect finger movement, allowing users to play a virtual piano or type with a virtual keyboard. – KAIST announced that Professor Yoo Hoi-joon and his team in the electrical engineering department developed ‘K-Glass 3’, which is a ULP AR smart glasses device that can recognize human body actions and movements.K-Glass 3 is the successor of the AR based K-Glass 1 developed in 2014, and K-Glass 2 developed in 2015, which can track eye movement. The new product was revealed at the International Solid State Circuits Conference held in San Francisco at the beginning of the month.The key technology of K-Glass 3 is the device’s stereo camera system. The system processes images obtained from two cameras, and extracts depth information, recognizing objects three dimensionally.With the system, users can type on a keyboard realized with the smart glasses and play a virtual piano, experiencing AR.The research team commented that there was no user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) to transfer text on the smart glasses prior to the recent development. They anticipate that smart glasses that detect motion will be useful to users that are used to text.K-Glass 3 runs on Ultra Low Power (ULP), and can be used for more than 24 hours on a single charge.AR devices prior to the K-Glass 3 used more than three watts of electric power due to complicated algorithms and motion-detecting sensors. It had been pointed out that the devices were difficult to adapt to the smart glasses system that used a battery equivalent to one fifth of the size of a smartphone.However, K-Glass 3’s stereo camera system realizes a stereo vision algorithm within a ULP processor, using an average of only 20 milliwatts of electric power, and stops operating when no motion is detected.The research team added that a more convenient and intuitive UI/UX should be developed, and UPL and downsizing should be implemented for the smart glasses market to actually replace smartphones.By Kevin Lee ()",Type on a Keyboard and Play Piano with AR Smart Glasses,http://koreabizwire.com/type-on-a-keyboard-and-play-piano-with-ar-smart-glasses/50470
"A KAIST professor has said artificial intelligence-based fact checkers could be more effective than humans in tackling fake news in the future.Professor Cha Mi-young, who teaches computing at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST), said big-data efforts to quickly discover and prevent fake news from spreading are more important than ever in the age of automated journalism.According to a study Cha cited during a policy forum on Thursday, artificial intelligence-based fact checkers are able to identify fake news with an 80 percent accuracy rate, even better than humans.Cha spoke during the event ‘Dinner and 4.0′, a monthly research conference for the fourth industrial revolution at KAIST where professors give presentations to researchers and students.“Nearly half of the top 20 news articles on Facebook with the most likes during the 2016 U.S. presidential election turned out to be fake news. (Fake news) took advantage of the fact that most people just see a photo, or read a title or a lead, instead of clicking to read the full article,” Cha said.The widely shared notion that the most-clicked articles have high-quality content on online media outlets played into the hands of fake news, according to some analysts.According to Cha, fake news tends to attract views over a longer period of time than credible news, which is often read soon after its published.“Fake news tends to be spread among unlikely people, as they share it among each other sporadically.”It is thought that fake news tends to begin with sentences like, ‘I’ve heard it from somewhere,’ ‘It is not clear,’ or ‘According to someone,’ all of which avoid direct responsibility.During the conference, predictions were made for the future of the media, with some suggesting news could be graded on a scale of one to five based on credibility.“People might want real news, but also other types of news at the lower end of the credibility scale for entertainment purposes,” Cha said while laughing.“In a new era for the media where decisions are made automatically, such as robot journalism, big data research to swiftly identify fake news and stop it from spreading is becoming increasingly necessary,” Cha added.Hyunsu Yim (hyunsu@koreabizwire.com)","AI Fact Checker Will Tackle Fake News, KAIST Professor Says",http://koreabizwire.com/ai-fact-checker-will-tackle-fake-news-kaist-professor-says/100863
"A group of South Korean scientists have developed a way to detect major diseases such as cancer or diabetes through respiration, a feat which can bring a seismic change to the methods of diagnosing patient illnesses, Seoul’s science ministry said Thursday. – A research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed a sensor capable of analyzing components of patients’ respiration and providing details on their health conditions.The Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning said the development, funded by the government, was made possible because gases emitted by patients include various volatile organic compounds that are possibly connected to different diseases.For example, a patient with diabetes tends to have more acetone in their breath. Previously, similar sensors failed to effectively find the substances selectively, as they only existed in small quantities.Traditional methods of disease diagnosis are blood testing or magnetic resonance imaging, which means that the new sensor can make such processes much easier, allowing patients to more promptly respond to their diseases.The sensor can also help patients keep track of their health through smartphones or other wearable devices.“(The sensor) can be applied in analyzing air pollution as well as other gas-detecting devices that connect to Internet of Things technology,” said KAIST professor Kim Il-Doo.The study is also posted on February’s material science journal “Small,” under the title “WO3 Nanofiber-Based Biomarker Detectors Enabled by Protein-Encapsulated Catalyst Self-Assembled on Polystyrene Colloid Templates.”(Yonhap)",S.

It is again set to jump 10.9 percent to 8,350 won per hour from the start of 2019.Some critics say the new cashier-less stores are still at a beginning stage, which is more close to self-service than automation.The E-Mart Everyday store, for one, requires visitors to scan the bar code of items on their own using their mobile phone. Security issues, such as shoplifting, remain a key challenge.“There is still much to be done before the retailers can actually commercialize these technologies.

The launch was further pushed back multiple times due to various weather conditions.It is a groundbreaking launch for SpaceX in numerous ways as not only is this the first time the company has reused the rocket for a third time but it is the biggest batch of satellites that has ever taken off on a single launch from U.S. soil.The Falcon 9 safely reentered the atmosphere and landed after about eight minutes of flight.Until now, practically all orbital rockets were disposable, meaning the rockets were discarded after launch. SpaceX has been reused twice.Experts forecast the launch would open the new horizons for spaceflight, with SpaceX hoping that the Falcon 9 rocket would be able make numerous trips into space, thus reducing costs.The rocket’s payload included 15 microsatellites and 49 CubeSats from both commercial and government entities, including 25 from international organizations.At present, South Korea operates four satellites for weather and Earth observation.(Yonhap)",S.

"Jerry Kaplan, a world-renowned scholar at Stanford University and an expert in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), said that the myth surrounding the topic is already very widely spread but that it would be “impossible” for robots to achieve the level of thinking humans are born with. — Kaplan, who is in Korea to attend the Munhwa Future Report, a forum on urgent global issues, spoke at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) yesterday, where he downplayed the suggestion by some academics that artificial intelligence will one day surpass human intelligence.Kaplan explained that through machine learning, robots may be able to extract useful information from a vast pool of data but would not become as “smart” as human beings.Kaplan also explained that artificial intelligence would merely make machines more intelligent to perform their jobs better.Regarding the myths surrounding artificial intelligence that have become popular in mainstream media, Kaplan blamed the entertainment industry for falsely portraying robots with human-like characteristics, an idea not based on scientific knowledge.Kaplan cited a New York Times article printed on July 8, 1958 which predicted that a computer “will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.”Kaplan argues, however, that such technology has yet to be developed.Kaplan also offered advice to Korean scholars and experts in the nation’s AI sector.“A significant amount of data should be collected and saved, more engineers than scientists should be nurtured, and the government should relax regulations and foster research with relevant infrastructure to ensure that AI technology is well executed,” said Kaplan.Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",AI Experts Downplays Notion of Robots Surpassing Humans,http://koreabizwire.com/ai-experts-downplays-notion-of-robots-surpassing-humans/123940
"A technology that can pinpoint the exact location of a user by collecting wireless signals from smartphones has been developed. — The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) announced on Monday that a research team led by Prof. Han Dong-soo has developed technology that can be used to recognize indoor locations based on crowd sourcing.The use of artificial intelligence (AI) that automatically labels wireless LAN fingerprint connection locations is the key behind the new technology.Wireless fingerprint refers to information regarding the strength of a wireless LAN signal in a specific location.Wireless signals collected through an unspecified number of smartphones are divided by buildings through clustering. The signals are then subdivided by each floor of the building using atmospheric pressure information.As long as one is within a building with a wireless LAN signal, the new technology can be applied to any building.Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) also figured in the development of the new technology. PDR is a method to calculate location by collecting and processing one’s speed, direction, and distance of movement.Based on wireless signals that are obtained from inertial sensors, the technology undergoes a process of machine learning related to a specific area or region to optimize the location of data collection.The research team measured the accuracy at an indoor shopping mall with a capacity of 400,000 square meters from the second basement floor to the sixth floor, and showed an accuracy of 3 to 6 meters.The technology was able to pinpoint the floor a user was on to an accuracy of 95 percent.The team predicted that using the new technology for signals collected through IT companies, telecommunications and online shopping mall applications will allow it to establish an indoor location infrastructure on a city or national scale.Kevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)",New Smartphone Tech Can Indicate Which Floor User is On,http://koreabizwire.com/new-smartphone-tech-can-indicate-which-floor-user-is-on/138732

"New advancements from South Korean researchers should soon allow smartphone users to simply knock on an object using their phone to automatically determine what type of object it is. — It is expected that this technology will be used for new services such as tapping a smartphone against a water container to order water.The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said Tuesday its own research team had developed so-called “knocker” technology and announced it at the ACM Ubiquitous Computing Academic Conference last month.Knocker technology analyzes responses caused by tapping a smartphone on an object through machine learning.Response data is detected by the smartphone’s microphone, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.Because the technology does not use existing recognition devices such as cameras and RFID electronic tags, it can be applied to dark places where cameras are difficult to use or to devices without electronic tags.Researchers input data of 23 types of objects that are accessible in daily life, such as laptop computers, water bottles and bicycles, and evaluated the accuracy of recognition.The knocker technology reported 98 percent accuracy when tested indoors.However, the accuracy dropped to 83 percent in noisy spaces such as crowded roads and restaurants. In addition, the time of recognition was only 0.2 seconds.It is predicted that if the new technology is applied, areas where smartphones are used could be expanded.Researchers showed 15 use cases such as tapping an empty bottle with a smartphone to automatically order water, and tapping one’s bed to turn off the lights before going to sleep.“These results are more meaningful because knocker technology uses sensor combination and machine learning from existing smartphones without special sensors or hardware development. It is also easy for any smartphone user to use it,” said Lee Sung-joo, the professor at KAIST who led the research team.H. M.
