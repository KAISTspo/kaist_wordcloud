0,Learning quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain,Legged locomotion can extend the operational domain of robots to some of the most challenging environments on Earth However conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion Here we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zeroshot generalization from simulation to natural environments The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training deformable terrains such as mud and snow dynamic footholds such as rubble and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains,https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/5/47/eabc5986

9,Dynamic metal-polymer interaction for the design of chemoselective and long-lived hydrogenation catalysts,Metal catalysts are generally supported on hard inorganic materials because of their high thermochemical stabilities Here we support Pd catalysts on a thermochemically stable but “soft” engineering plastic polyphenylene sulfide PPS for acetylene partial hydrogenation Near the glass transition temperature 353 K the mobile PPS chains cover the entire surface of Pd particles via strong metalpolymer interactions The PdPPS interface enables H2 activation only in the presence of acetylene that has a strong binding affinity to Pd and thus can disturb the PdPPS interface Once acetylene is hydrogenated to weakly binding ethylene readsorption of PPS on the Pd surface repels ethylene before it is further hydrogenated to ethane The PdPPS interaction enables selective partial hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene even in an ethylenerich stream and suppresses catalyst deactivation due to coke formation The results manifest the unique possibility of harnessing dynamic metalpolymer interaction for designing chemoselective and longlived catalysts,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/28/eabb7369

37,Springtail-inspired superomniphobic surface with extreme pressure resistance,Both high static repellency and pressure resistance are critical to achieving a highperformance omniphobic surface The cuticles of springtails have both of these features which result from their hierarchical structure composed of primary doubly reentrant nanostructures on secondary microgrooves Despite intensive efforts none of the previous studies that were inspired by the springtail were able to simultaneously achieve both high static repellency and pressure resistance because of a general tradeoff between these characteristics We demonstrate for the first time a springtailinspired superomniphobic surface displaying both features by fabricating a hierarchical system consisting of serifT–shaped nanostructures on microscale wrinkles overcoming previous limitations Our biomimetic strategy yielded a surface showing high repellency to diverse liquids from water to ethanol with a contact angle above 150° Simultaneously the surface was able to endure extreme pressure resulting from the impacts of drops of water and of ethylene glycol with We  200 and of ethanol with We  53 which is the highest pressure resistance ever reported Overall the omniphobicity of our springtailinspired fabricated system was found to be superior to that of the natural springtail cuticle itself,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/8/eaat4978

40,Selective formation of γ-lactams via C–H amidation enabled by tailored iridium catalysts,Intramolecular insertion of metal nitrenes into carbonhydrogen bonds to form γlactam rings has traditionally been hindered by competing isocyanate formation We report the application of theory and mechanism studies to optimize a class of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridiumIII catalysts for suppression of this competing pathway Modulation of the stereoelectronic properties of the auxiliary bidentate ligands to be more electrondonating was suggested by density functional theory calculations to lower the C–H insertion barrier favoring the desired reaction These catalysts transform a wide range of 142dioxazol5ones carbonylnitrene precursors easily accessible from carboxylic acids into the corresponding γlactams via sp3 and sp2 C–H amidation with exceptional selectivity The power of this method was further demonstrated by the successful latestage functionalization of amino acid derivatives and other bioactive molecules,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6379/1016

42,Holographic deep learning for rapid optical screening of anthrax spores,Establishing early warning systems for anthrax attacks is crucial in biodefense Despite numerous studies for decades the limited sensitivity of conventional biochemical methods essentially requires preprocessing steps and thus has limitations to be used in realistic settings of biological warfare We present an optical method for rapid and labelfree screening of Bacillus anthracis spores through the synergistic application of holographic microscopy and deep learning A deep convolutional neural network is designed to classify holographic images of unlabeled living cells After training the network outperforms previous techniques in all accuracy measures achieving singlespore sensitivity and subgenus specificity The unique “representation learning” capability of deep learning enables direct training from raw images instead of manually extracted features The method automatically recognizes key biological traits encoded in the images and exploits them as fingerprints This remarkable learning ability makes the proposed method readily applicable to classifying various single cells in addition to B anthracis as demonstrated for the diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes without any modification We believe that our strategy will make holographic microscopy more accessible to medical doctors and biomedical scientists for easy rapid and accurate pointofcare diagnosis of pathogens,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700606
43,Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering,The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all lowenergy neutrino couplings This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size with potential technological applications We observed this process at a 67σ confidence level using a lowbackground 146kilogram CsINa scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Characteristic signatures in energy and time predicted by the standard model for this process were observed in high signaltobackground conditions Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1123
44,Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries,Lithiumion batteries with everincreasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and allelectric vehicles Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode material because of its superior specific capacity During repeated chargedischarge cycles silicon undergoes huge volume changes This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrodeelectrolyte interface especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range We show that the incorporation of 5 weight  polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the polymer network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration enabling stable cycle life for silicon microparticle anodes at commerciallevel areal capacities,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6348/279
45,Inositol polyphosphate multikinase promotes Toll-like receptor–induced inflammation by stabilizing TRAF6,Tolllike receptor TLR signaling is tightly controlled to protect hosts from microorganisms while simultaneously preventing uncontrolled immune responses Tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 TRAF6 is a critical mediator of TLR signaling but the precise mechanism of how TRAF6 protein stability is strictly controlled still remains obscure We show that myeloidspecific deletion of inositol polyphosphate multikinase IPMK which has both inositol polyphosphate kinase activities and noncatalytic signaling functions protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis and lipopolysaccharideinduced systemic inflammation IPMK depletion in macrophages results in decreased levels of TRAF6 protein thereby dampening TLRinduced signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production Mechanistically the regulatory role of IPMK is independent of its catalytic function instead reflecting its direct binding to TRAF6 This interaction stabilizes TRAF6 by blocking its K48linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome Thus these findings identify IPMK as a key determinant of TRAF6 stability and elucidate the physiological function of IPMK in TLRinduced innate immunity,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602296
46,Robotic vertical jumping agility via series-elastic power modulation,Several arboreal mammals have the ability to rapidly and repeatedly jump vertical distances of 2 m starting from rest We characterize this performance by a metric we call vertical jumping agility Through basic kinetic relations we show that this agility metric is fundamentally constrained by available actuator power Although rapid high jumping is an important performance characteristic the ability to control forces during stance also appears critical for sophisticated behaviors The animal with the highest vertical jumping agility the galago Galago senegalensis is known to use a powermodulating strategy to obtain higher peak power than that of muscle alone Few previous robots have used serieselastic power modulation achieved by combining serieselastic actuation with variable mechanical advantage and because of motor power limits the best current robot has a vertical jumping agility of only 55 of a galago Through use of a specialized leg mechanism designed to enhance power modulation we constructed a jumping robot that achieved 78 of the vertical jumping agility of a galago Agile robots can explore venues of locomotion that were not previously attainable We demonstrate this with a wall jump where the robot leaps from the floor to a wall and then springs off the wall to reach a net height that is greater than that accessible by a single jump Our results show that serieselastic power modulation is an actuation strategy that enables a clade of vertically agile robots,https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/eaag2048
47,A chemical biology route to site-specific authentic protein modifications,Many essential biological processes are controlled by posttranslational protein modifications The inability to synthetically attain the diversity enabled by these modifications limits functional studies of many proteins We designed a threestep approach for installing authentic posttranslational modifications in recombinant proteins We first use the established Ophosphoserine Sep orthogonal translation system to create a Sepcontaining recombinant protein The Sep residue is then dephosphorylated to dehydroalanine Dha Last conjugate addition of alkyl iodides to Dha promoted by zinc and copper enables chemoselective carboncarbon bond formation To validate our approach we produced histone H3 ubiquitin and green fluorescent protein variants with sitespecific modifications including different methylations of H3K79 The methylated histones stimulate transcription through histone acetylation This approach offers a powerful tool to engineer diverse designer proteins,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6312/623
48,Amelioration of sepsis by TIE2 activation–induced vascular protection,Protection of endothelial integrity has been recognized as a frontline approach to alleviating sepsis progression yet no effective agent for preserving endothelial integrity is available Using an unusual anti–angiopoietin 2 ANG2 antibody ABTAA ANG2binding and TIE2activating antibody we show that activation of the endothelial receptor TIE2 protects the vasculature from septic damage and provides survival benefit in three sepsis mouse models Upon binding to ANG2 ABTAA triggers clustering of ANG2 assembling an ABTAAANG2 complex that can subsequently bind and activate TIE2 Compared with a conventional ANG2blocking antibody ABTAA was highly effective in augmenting survival from sepsis by strengthening the endothelial glycocalyx reducing cytokine storms vascular leakage and rarefaction and mitigating organ damage Together our data advance the role of TIE2 activation in ameliorating sepsis progression and open a potential therapeutic avenue for sepsis to address the lack of sepsisspecific treatment,https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/335/335ra55
49,Overcoming the electroluminescence efficiency limitations of perovskite light-emitting diodes,Organicinorganic hybrid perovskites are emerging lowcost emitters with very high color purity but their low luminescent efficiency is a critical drawback We boosted the current efficiency CE of perovskite lightemitting diodes with a simple bilayer structure to 429 candela per ampere similar to the CE of phosphorescent organic lightemitting diodes with two modifications We prevented the formation of metallic lead Pb atoms that cause strong exciton quenching through a small increase in methylammonium bromide MABr molar proportion and we spatially confined the exciton in uniform MAPbBr3 nanograins average diameter  997 nanometers formed by a nanocrystal pinning process and concomitant reduction of exciton diffusion length to 67 nanometers These changes caused substantial increases in steadystate photoluminescence intensity and efficiency of MAPbBr3 nanograin layers,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6265/1222
50,CO2 capture from humid flue gases and humid atmosphere using a microporous coppersilicate,Capturing CO2 from humid flue gases and atmosphere with porous materials remains costly because prior dehydration of the gases is required A large number of microporous materials with physical adsorption capacity have been developed as CO2capturing materials However most of them suffer from CO2 sorption capacity reduction or structure decomposition that is caused by coadsorbed H2O when exposed to humid flue gases and atmosphere We report a highly stable microporous coppersilicate It has H2Ospecific and CO2specific adsorption sites but does not have H2OCO2sharing sites Therefore it readily adsorbs both H2O and CO2 from the humid flue gases and atmosphere but the adsorbing H2O does not interfere with the adsorption of CO2 It is also highly stable after adsorption of H2O and CO2 because it was synthesized hydrothermally,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6258/302
51,Spring-loaded unraveling of a single SNARE complex by NSF in one round of ATP turnover,During intracellular membrane trafficking Nethylmaleimidesensitive factor NSF and alphasoluble NSF attachment protein αSNAP disassemble the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor SNARE complex for recycling of the SNARE proteins The molecular mechanism by which NSF disassembles the SNARE complex is largely unknown Using singlemolecule fluorescence spectroscopy and magnetic tweezers we found that NSF disassembled a single SNARE complex in only one round of adenosine triphosphate ATP turnover Upon ATP cleavage the NSF hexamer developed internal tension with dissociation of phosphate ions After latent time measuring tens of seconds NSF released the builtup tension in a burst within 20 milliseconds resulting in disassembly followed by immediate release of the SNARE proteins Thus NSF appears to use a “springloaded” mechanism to couple ATP hydrolysis and unfolding of substrate proteins,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6229/1485
